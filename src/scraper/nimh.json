The first steps to research participation include: calling the NIMH research study team to learn study details, an evaluation for eligibility to enroll, and consenting to participate.\n\n\nThe studies are conducted at the NIH Clinical Center (CC), a hospital dedicated to the highest quality research, and located in Bethesda, Maryland, near Washington, D.C. Some studies enroll locally, others regionally or nationally. Please contact each research study team to learn more specifics.\n\n\nAdult, Children and Healthy Volunteer study descriptions and other information provided here can help you decide whether to participate or volunteer. If you qualify for a study, then a study-related evaluation, treatment and, in some cases transportation to NIH is provided without cost to you or your health plan.\n\n"},

", "text": "\n  \nWhy is women’s mental health important? \n\n  \n    \n\n\nMental disorders can affect women and men differently. Some disorders are more common in women, such as \ndepression: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/depression-in-women \n\n, \nanxiety: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/anxiety-disorders \n\n, and \neating disorders: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/eating-disorders \n\n. There are also certain disorders that are unique to women. For example, some women experience symptoms of depression: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/depression-in-women \n at times of hormone change, such as during or after pregnancy (\nperinatal depression: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/perinatal-depression \n: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/depression-in-women \n\n), around the time of their period (premenstrual dysphoric disorder), and during menopause (perimenopause-related depression: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/depression-in-women \n).\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to other mental disorders, such as \nschizophrenia: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/schizophrenia \n\n and \nbipolar disorder: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/bipolar-disorder \n\n, research has not found sex differences in the rates at which they are diagnosed. But certain symptoms may be more common in women than men, and the course of illness can be affected by a person’s sex. Researchers are only now beginning to tease apart the various biological and psychosocial factors that may impact mental health.\n\n\n\nMental health includes emotional, psychological, and social well-being.

The goal of clinical trials is to determine if a new test or treatment works and is safe. Although people may benefit from being part of a clinical trial, they should be aware that the primary purpose of a clinical trial is to gain new scientific knowledge so that others can be better helped in the future. \nResearchers at NIMH and around the country conduct many studies with patients and healthy volunteers. We have new and better treatment options today because of what clinical trials have uncovered. Talk to a health care provider about clinical trials, their benefits and risks, and whether one is right for you.\nNIMH researchers are currently working to identify the causes of, treatments for, and predictors of risk for reproductive endocrine-related mood disorders, including the following:\nPostpartum depression: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-conducted-at-nimh/research-areas/clinics-and-labs/sbe/participate-in-research/postpartum-depression \n\nPremenstrual dysphoric disorder: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-conducted-at-nimh/research-areas/clinics-and-labs/sbe/participate-in-research/premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder \n\nPerimenopausal depression: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-conducted-at-nimh/research-areas/clinics-and-labs/sbe/participate-in-research/perimenopausal-depression \n\nIn addition to these disorders, NIMH researchers are also studying other mental disorders that affect women.

{"title": "Technology and the Future of Mental Health Treatment", "heading": "How is technology used for mental health treatment?", "text": "\n  \nHow is technology used for mental health treatment?\n\n  \n    \n\n\nTechnology has opened a new frontier in mental health care and data collection. Mobile devices like cell phones, smartphones, and tablets are giving the public, health care providers, and researchers new ways to access help, monitor progress, and increase understanding of mental well-being.\n\n\n\nMobile mental health support can be very simple but effective. For example, anyone with a phone or computer can call, text, or chat the \n988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline: https://988lifeline.org/ \n\n \n at any time.\n\n\n\nNew technology can also be packaged into an extremely sophisticated app for smartphones or tablets. Such apps might use the device’s built-in sensors to collect information on a user’s typical behavior patterns. Then, if the app detects a change in behavior, it can signal that help is needed before a crisis occurs.\n\n\n\nSome apps are stand-alone programs designed to improve memory or thinking skills. Other apps help people connect to a peer counselor or a health care professional.\n\n\n\nExcitement about the huge range of opportunities technology offers for mental health treatment has led to a burst of development. Thousands of mental health apps are available in iTunes and Android app stores, and the number is growing every year. However, this new technology frontier includes a lot of uncertainty. There is very little industry regulation and very little information on app effectiveness, which can lead people to wonder which apps they should trust.\n\n\n\nBefore focusing on the state of the science and where it may lead, it’s important to look at the advantages and disadvantages of expanding mental health treatment and research into a mobile world.\n\n\n\n\n"},
{"title": "Technology and the Future of Mental Health Treatment", "heading": "What are the pros and cons of mental health apps?", "text": "\n  \nWhat are the pros and cons of mental health apps?\n\n  \n    \n\n\nMental health apps and other technology have a lot of potential, both for people seeking mental health care and mental health professionals providing such services. Some advantages of mobile care technology include the following.\n\n\n\nConvenience\n: Allows treatment to take place anytime and anywhere, such as at home in the middle of the night or on a bus on the way to work, making it ideal for people who have trouble getting to in-person appointments\n\n\t\nAnonymity\n: Lets people receive treatment anonymously and privately from the comfort of their homes\n\n\t\nIntroduction to care\n: Acts as a good first step for people who have been reluctant to seek mental health care in the past\n\n\t\nLower cost\n: Makes care more affordable through apps that are free or cheaper than traditional in-person care\n\n\t\nGreater outreach\n: Helps mental health professionals offer treatment to people in remote areas or to large numbers of people in times of sudden need, like after a natural disaster or traumatic event\n\n\t\nInterest\n: Encourages people to continue therapy by making care more appealing and accessible than traditional in-person treatment\n\n\t\n24-hour service\n: Provides around-the-clock monitoring or intervention support\n\n\t\nConsistency\n: Offers the same treatment program to all people\n\n\t\nSupport\n: Complements traditional therapy by extending in-person sessions, reinforcing new skills, and providing support and monitoring\n\n\t\nData collection\n: Collects information, such as location, movement, phone use, and other data\n\n\nMental health technology offers great opportunities but also raises concerns. Addressing potential problems will be essential to ensuring that new apps provide benefits without causing harm. Although apps are becoming more appealing and user-friendly, we need more information on their effectiveness.\n\n\n\nThe following are some limitations of the technology that researchers and developers are trying to answer questions about.\n\n\n\nEffectiveness\n: Is the app supported by scientific evidence showing that it works and works as well as traditional in-person methods?\n\n\t\nAudience\n: Does the app work equally well for all people it is meant to help?\n\n\t\nPrivacy\n: How does the app maker guarantee users’ privacy, considering many apps deal with sensitive personal information?\n\n\t\nGuidance\n: How do people determine if an app is effective when no industry-wide standards exist for evaluating quality?\n\n\t\nRegulation\n: Who should regulate mental health technology and the data it generates?\n\n\t\nOverselling\n: Does the app promise more than it delivers and turn people away from using other, more effective therapies?\n\n\n\n\n"},
{"title": "Technology and the Future of Mental Health Treatment", "heading": "What are current trends in app development?", "text": "\n  \nWhat are current trends in app development?\n\n  \n    \n\n\nResearch and engineering teams are combining their skills to address a wide range of mental health concerns. For instance, intervention apps may help people quit smoking; manage symptoms of anxiety, depression, eating disorders, post-traumatic stress, or insomnia; and more. Some popular areas of app development include the following.\n\n\n\nSelf-management\n\n\n\nSelf-management apps involve people putting information into the app to receive feedback. For example, they might use the app to set medication reminders or access tools for managing stress, anxiety, or sleep problems. Some software can use additional equipment to track heart rate, breathing patterns, blood pressure, and so forth to help people monitor their progress and receive feedback.\n\n\n\nImprove thinking skills\n\n\n\nCognitive remediation apps help people improve their thinking skills. These apps are often designed for people with serious mental illnesses who may have distorted or unhelpful ways of thinking or hold inaccurate beliefs.\n\n\n\nSkill training\n\n\n\nSkill training apps may feel more like games than other mental health apps as they help people learn new coping or thinking skills. These apps might involve watching an educational video about anxiety management or the importance of social support, for example. People then pick new strategies to try and use the app to track how often they practice those new skills.\n\n\n\nIllness management and supported care\n\n\n\nIllness management and supported care apps provide additional support by allowing people to interact with another person. The app may connect people with peer support or send information to a trained health care provider who can offer guidance and therapy options. Researchers are working to learn how much human interaction people need for app-based treatments to be effective.\n\n\n\nPassive symptom tracking\n\n\n\nSymptom tracking apps collect data using the sensors built into smartphones. The sensors might record movement patterns, social interactions (such as the number of texts and phone calls), behavior at different times of day, vocal tone and speed, and more. In the future, apps may be able to analyze these data to determine a person’s real-time state of mind. Such apps may also recognize changes in behavior patterns that signal an episode of mania, depression, or psychosis before it occurs. Although an app may not replace a mental health professional, it can alert caregivers when someone needs additional help.

Receiving widescale information from many people at the same time can increase researchers’ understanding of mental health and help them develop better interventions.\n\n\n\nConducting research\n\n\n\nApps can help conduct research. For example, Dr. Patricia Areán’s pioneering \nBRIGTHEN study: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/archive/news/2016/a-bright-technological-future-for-mental-health-trials \n \nshowed that research via a smartphone app is a reality. The BRIGHTEN study was remarkable because it used technology to both deliver treatment and conduct research. In other words, the research team used technology to recruit, screen, enroll, treat, and assess participants. BRIGHTEN was especially exciting because the study showed that technology can be an efficient way to test promising new treatments, while also highlighting the need to make those treatments engaging.\n\n\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling or having thoughts of suicide, call or text the \n988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline: https://988lifeline.org: https://988lifeline.org/chat/ \n/ \n\n \n at \n988 \nor\n \nchat at \n988lifeline.org: https://988lifeline.org/chat/ \n\n \n.

Researchers have found that interventions are most effective when people like them, are engaged in them, and want to continue using them. Behavioral health apps work best when they combine engineers’ skills for making an app easy to use and entertaining with providers’ skills for providing effective treatment options. Researchers and engineers are developing and testing apps that do everything from manage medications to teach coping skills to predict when someone may need emotional help.\n\n\n\n\n"},
{"title": "Technology and the Future of Mental Health Treatment", "heading": "Who evaluates mental health apps?", "text": "\n  \nWho evaluates mental health apps?\n\n  \n    \n\n\nThere are no review boards, checklists, or widely accepted rules for evaluating or choosing a mental health app or other technology. Most apps do not have peer-reviewed research to support their claims, and it is unlikely that every mental health app will go through a randomized clinical research trial to test its effectiveness. One reason is that testing is a slow process, and technology evolves quickly. By the time an app has been put through rigorous scientific testing, the original technology may be outdated.\n\n\n\nCurrently, there are no national standards for evaluating the effectiveness of the hundreds of available mental health apps. People should be cautious about trusting an app. However, there are a few suggestions for finding an app that may work for you:\n\n\n\nAsk a trusted health care provider for a recommendation. Some larger providers may offer several apps and collect data on their use.\n\n\t\nCheck to see if the app offers recommendations for what to do if symptoms get worse or there is a psychiatric emergency. Know how to get help if needed.\n\n\t\nDecide if you want an app that is completely automated versus an app that offers opportunities for contact with a trained professional.\n\n\t\nSearch for information on the app developer, including their credentials and experience. \n\n\t\nBeware of misleading logos. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has not developed and does not endorse any apps. However, some app developers have unlawfully used the NIMH logo to market their products.\n\n\t\nSearch the \nPubMed database: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ \n \n offered by the National Library of Medicine. This resource contains articles on a wide range of research topics, including mental health app development.\n\n\t\nIf you cannot find information about a particular app, check to see if the app is based on a treatment that has been tested. For example, research has shown that internet-based cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is as effective as conventional CBT for disorders that include depression, anxiety, social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder.\n\n\t\nTry it. If you’re interested in an app, test it for a few days and decide if it’s easy to use, holds your attention, and is something you want to continue using. An app is only effective if it keeps you engaged.\n\n\n\n\n"},

{"title": "Psychotherapies", "heading": "Elements of psychotherapy", "text": "\n  \nElements of psychotherapy\n\n  \n    \nA variety of psychotherapies and interventions have shown effectiveness in treating mental health disorders. Often, the type of treatment is tailored to the specific disorder. For example, the treatment approach for someone who has obsessive-compulsive disorder is different than the approach for someone who has bipolar disorder. Therapists may use one primary approach or incorporate other elements depending on their training, the disorder being treated, and the needs of the person receiving treatment.\n\n\n\nElements of psychotherapy can include:\n\n\n\nHelping a person become aware of automatic ways of thinking that are inaccurate or harmful (for example, having a low opinion of their abilities) and then finding ways to question those thoughts, understand how the thoughts affect their emotions and behavior, and change self-defeating patterns, in an approach known as \ncognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/anxiety-disorders#part_2225 \n\n\n\t\nIdentifying ways to cope with stress and developing specific problem-solving strategies\n\n\t\nExamining a person’s interactions with others and teaching social and communication skills\n\n\t\nApplying mindfulness and relaxation techniques, such as meditation and breathing exercises\n\n\t\nUsing exposure therapy (a type of CBT) for people with anxiety disorders, in which a person spends brief periods in a supportive environment learning to tolerate the distress caused by certain items, ideas, or imagined scenes until, over time, the fear associated with those things dissipates\n\n\t\nTracking emotions and behaviors to raise awareness of their impact on each other\n\n\t\nUsing supportive counseling to help a person explore troubling issues and receive emotional support\n\n\t\nCreating a safety plan to help a person who has thoughts of self-harm or suicide recognize warning signs and use coping strategies, such as contacting friends, family, or emergency personnel\n\n\nNote that there are many different types of psychotherapy. Therapies are often variations of an established approach, such as CBT. There is no formal approval process for psychotherapies like there is for medications by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\n\n\nHowever, for many therapies, research involving large numbers of patients has provided evidence that the treatment is effective. These evidence-based therapies have been shown to reduce symptoms of depression, anxiety, and other mental disorders. \nNIMH's health topic pages: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics \n\n list some of the evidence-based therapies used to treat specific disorders. \n\n\n"},

Therapists may combine and adapt elements of different approaches.\n\n\n\nOnce you have identified one or more possible therapists, a preliminary conversation can help you understand how treatment will proceed and decide if you feel comfortable with the therapist. Rapport and trust are essential. Discussions in therapy are deeply personal, and it’s important that you feel comfortable with the therapist and have confidence in their expertise. These preliminary conversations may happen in person, by phone, or virtually. Consider trying to get answers to the following questions:\n\n\n\nWhat are the credentials and experience of the therapist? Do they have a specialty?\n\n\t\nWhat approach will the therapist take to help you? Do they practice a particular type of therapy? What is the rationale for the therapy and its evidence base?\n\n\t\nDoes the therapist have experience in diagnosing and treating the age group (for example, a child) and the specific condition for which treatment is being sought? If the patient is a child, how will parents or caregivers be involved in treatment?\n\n\t\nWhat are the goals of therapy? Does the therapist recommend a specific time frame or number of sessions? How will progress be assessed, and what happens if you (or the therapist) feel you aren't starting to improve?\n\n\t\nAre medications an option? Is this therapist able to prescribe medications?\n\n\t\nAre meetings confidential? How is confidentiality assured? Are there limits to confidentiality?\n\n\n\n"},

Although older antidepressant medications, such as tricyclics and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), are associated with more side effects, they may be the best option for some people.\n\n\n\nAntidepressant medications take time to work—usually 4 to 8 weeks—and symptoms such as problems with sleep, appetite, energy, or concentration sometimes improve before mood lifts. It is important for people to follow their health care provider’s directions and take the medication for the recommended amount of time before deciding whether it works.\n\n\n\nCommon side effects of SSRIs and other antidepressants may include upset stomach, headache, or sexual dysfunction.

People who are sensitive to the side effects of these medications sometimes benefit from starting with a low dose, increasing the daily dose very slowly, and adjusting when they take the medication (for example, at bedtime or with food).\n\n\n\nEsketamine: https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a619017.html \n \n is a newer FDA-approved medication for treatment-resistant depression: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/depression \n, which may be diagnosed when a person’s symptoms have not improved after trying at least two antidepressant therapies. Esketamine: https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a619017.html \n is delivered as a nasal spray in a health care provider’s office, a clinic, or a hospital. It often acts rapidly—typically within a couple of hours—to relieve depression: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/depression \n symptoms. People usually continue to take an oral antidepressant to maintain the improvement in symptoms.\n\n\n\nCombining antidepressants with medications or supplements that also act on the serotonin system, such as “triptan” medications (often used to treat migraine headaches) and St. John’s Wort (a dietary supplement), can cause a rare but life-threatening illness called \nserotonin syndrome: https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007272.htm \n \n. Symptoms of serotonin syndrome: https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007272.htm \n include agitation, muscle twitches, hallucinations (seeing or hearing things others do not see or hear), high temperature, and unusual blood pressure changes. For most people, the risk of such extreme reactions is low. It is important for health care providers to consider all possible interactions and use extra care in prescribing and monitoring medication combinations that carry above-average risk.\n\n\n\nPlease note: \nIn some cases, children, teenagers, and young adults under 25 may experience an increase in suicidal thoughts or behavior when taking antidepressants, especially in the first few weeks after starting the medication or when the dose is changed. People of all ages taking antidepressants should be watched closely, especially during the first few weeks of treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling or having thoughts of suicide, call or text the \n988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline: https://988lifeline.org: https://988lifeline.org/ \n/ \n\n \n at \n988 \nor chat at \n988lifeline.org: https://988lifeline.org/ \n\n \n.

In the case of \npanic disorder: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/panic-disorder-when-fear-overwhelms \n\n or \nsocial anxiety: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/anxiety-disorders \n disorder\n, health care providers typically start with SSRIs or other antidepressants as the first treatment because they have fewer side effects than other medications.\n\n\n\nAnother common type of anti-anxiety: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/anxiety-disorders \n medication is benzodiazepines. These medications are sometimes used to treat \ngeneralized anxiety: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/anxiety-disorders \n disorder\n.\n\n\n\nShort half-life (or short-acting) benzodiazepines are used to treat the short-term symptoms of anxiety: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/anxiety-disorders \n. Health care providers may also prescribe beta-blockers off-label to treat short-term symptoms. People with phobias—an overwhelming and unreasonable fear of an object or situation, such as public speaking—often experience intense physical symptoms. Beta-blockers can help manage these symptoms, such as rapid heart rate, sweating, and tremors.\n\n\n\nAs short-term treatments, benzodiazepines and beta-blockers can be used as needed to reduce severe anxiety: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/anxiety-disorders \n. Taking benzodiazepines over long periods may lead to drug tolerance or even dependence. To avoid these problems, health care providers usually prescribe benzodiazepines for short periods and taper them slowly to reduce the likelihood that a person will experience withdrawal symptoms or renewed anxiety: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/anxiety-disorders \n symptoms. Beta-blockers generally are not recommended for people with asthma or diabetes because they may worsen symptoms related to both conditions.\n\n\n\nBuspirone: https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a688005.html \n \n is a different type of medication that is sometimes used to treat anxiety: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/anxiety-disorders \n over longer periods. In contrast to benzodiazepines, buspirone must be taken every day for 3 to 4 weeks to reach its full effect and is not effective for treating anxiety: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/anxiety-disorders \n on an “as-needed” basis.\n\n\n\n\n"},
{"title": "Mental Health Medications", "heading": "Stimulants", "text": "\n  \nStimulants\n\n  \n    \n\n\nHealth care providers may prescribe stimulant medications when treating \nattention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd \n\n and \nnarcolepsy: https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/narcolepsy/ \n \n. Stimulants increase alertness, attention, and energy. They can also elevate blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing.\n\n\n\nPrescription stimulants typically improve alertness and focus for most people, regardless of diagnosis. These medications can markedly improve daily functioning for people with significant focus problems, such as people with ADHD. Although motor hyperactivity associated with ADHD in children usually goes away by the time they reach adolescence, people with ADHD may continue to experience inattention and difficulty with focus into adulthood. As such, stimulant medications can be helpful for adults with ADHD, as well as for children and adolescents with ADHD.\n\n\n\nStimulant medications are safe when taken under a health care provider’s supervision and used as directed. Some children taking them may report feeling slightly different or “funny.” Most side effects of stimulant medications are minor and disappear at lower doses.\n\n\n\nSome parents worry that stimulant medications may lead to misuse or dependence, but evidence shows this is unlikely when the medications are used as prescribed. Other challenges with stimulant treatment, such as sleep disturbance and slowed growth, can generally be safely managed in collaboration with the prescribing health care provider while continuing treatment.\n\n\n\n\n"},
{"title": "Mental Health Medications", "heading": "Antipsychotics", "text": "\n  \nAntipsychotics\n\n  \n    \n\n\nAntipsychotic medications are typically used to treat \npsychosis: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/understanding-psychosis \n\n, a condition that involves some loss of contact with reality. People experiencing a psychotic episode often experience delusions (false beliefs) or hallucinations (hearing or seeing things others do not see or hear). Psychosis can be related to drug use or a mental disorder such as \nschizophrenia: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/schizophrenia \n\n, \nbipolar disorder: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/bipolar-disorder \n\n, or severe \ndepression: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/depression \n\n (also known as “psychotic depression: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/depression \n”).\n\n\n\nHealth care providers may also prescribe antipsychotic medications in combination with other medications to relieve symptoms associated with delirium, dementia, or other mental health conditions. Antipsychotic treatment for older adults necessitates additional care and consideration. The FDA requires that all antipsychotic medication labels include a black-box warning stating that antipsychotics are associated with increased rates of stroke and death in older adults with dementia.\n\n\n\nOlder, first-generation antipsychotic medications are sometimes called “typical” antipsychotics or “neuroleptics.” Long-term use of typical antipsychotic medications may lead to a condition involving uncontrollable muscle movements called tardive dyskinesia (TD). TD can range from mild to severe. People who think they might have TD should check with their health care provider before stopping their medication.\n\n\n\nNewer, second-generation medications are sometimes called “atypical” antipsychotics. Several atypical antipsychotics may be used to treat a broader range of symptoms compared with older medications. For example, these medications are sometimes used to treat bipolar depression: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/depression \n or depression: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/depression \n that has not responded to antidepressant medication alone. Health care providers may ask people taking atypical antipsychotic medications to participate in regular monitoring to check weight, glucose levels, and lipid levels.\n\n\n\nSome symptoms, such as feeling agitated and having hallucinations, typically go away within days of starting antipsychotic medication. Other symptoms, such as delusions, usually go away within a few weeks of starting antipsychotic medication. However, people may not experience the full effects of antipsychotic medication for up to 6 weeks.\n\n\n\nIf a person’s symptoms do not improve with usual antipsychotic medications, they may be prescribed an atypical antipsychotic called \nclozapine: https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a691001.html \n \n. People who take clozapine: https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a691001.html \n must have regular blood tests to check for a potentially dangerous side effect that occurs in 1% to 2% of people.\n\n\n\n\n"},

Some studies indicate that lithium may reduce the risk of suicide among people taking it for long-term maintenance. Health care providers generally ask people who are taking lithium to participate in regular monitoring to check lithium levels and kidney and thyroid function.\n\n\n\nMood stabilizers are sometimes used to treat depression (usually with an antidepressant), schizoaffective disorder, disorders of impulse control, and certain mental illnesses in children. For people with bipolar depression, health care providers typically prescribe a mood stabilizer and an antidepressant to reduce the risk of switching into mania or rapid cycling.\n\n\n\nSome anticonvulsant medications may also be used as mood stabilizers, as they may work better than lithium for some people, such as people with “mixed” symptoms of mania and depression or those with rapid-cycling bipolar disorder. Health care providers generally ask people taking anticonvulsants to participate in regular monitoring to check medication levels and assess side effects and potential interactions with other common medications.\n\n\n\n\n"},
{"title": "Mental Health Medications", "heading": "Special Groups: Children, Older Adults, Pregnant People", "text": "\n  \nSpecial Groups: Children, Older Adults, Pregnant People\n\n  \n    \n\n\nAll types of people take mental health medications, but some groups have special needs and considerations.\n\n\n\nChildren and Adolescents\n\n\n\nMany medications used to treat mental disorders are safe and effective for children and adolescents. However, it is important to know that children may experience different reactions and side effects than adults, and some medications have FDA warnings about potential side effects for younger people.\n\n\n\nIn some cases, a health care provider may prescribe an FDA-approved medication on an “off-label” basis to treat a child’s symptoms even though the medication is not approved for the child’s specific mental disorder or for use by people under a certain age. Although there has been less research on mental disorders in children than in adults, there is some evidence that medications can be helpful for children. It is important to monitor children and adolescents who take medications on an “off-label” basis.\n\n\n\nA child’s health care provider may suggest trying non-medication treatments, such as \npsychotherapies: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/psychotherapies \n: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/psychotherapies: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/psychotherapies \n \n\n, first and may add medication later, if necessary. In other cases, the health care provider may suggest non-medication treatment in combination with medication. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) fact sheet \nChildren and Mental Health: Is This Just a Stage?: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/children-and-mental-health \n\n provides more information about common treatment options for children and adolescents.\n\n\n\nOlder Adults\n\n\n\nPeople over 65 should take extra care with medications, especially if they are taking many different medications. Older adults have a higher risk of experiencing drug interactions and are often more sensitive to medications. Even healthy older adults react to medications differently than younger people do because older adults’ bodies often process and eliminate medications more slowly.\n\n\n\nBefore starting a medication, older adults and their family members should talk with a health care provider about any effects the medication may have on physical and mental functioning. The health care provider can also discuss strategies to make it easier to follow the treatment plan, helping to ensure that older adults take the correct medication dose at the correct time.\n\n\n\nThe National Institute on Aging’s \nSafe Use of Medicines for Older Adults: https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/safe-use-medicines-older-adults \n \n booklet offers information and practical tips to help older people take their medications safely.\n\n\n\nPeople Who Are Pregnant or Who May Become Pregnant\n\n\n\nResearchers are continuing to investigate the use of mental health medications during pregnancy. The risks associated with taking medication during pregnancy depend on the type of medication and the stage of pregnancy. While no medication is considered universally safe during pregnancy, untreated mental disorders can also pose risks to the pregnant person and the developing fetus.\n\n\n\nPregnant people and health care providers can work together to develop a personalized treatment plan that considers individual needs and circumstances. It is important to weigh the benefits and risks associated with all available treatment options, including \npsychotherapies: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/psychotherapies \n: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/psychotherapies: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/psychotherapies \n \n\n, medications, \nbrain stimulation therapies: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/brain-stimulation-therapies/brain-stimulation-therapies \n\n, or a combination of these options. Health care providers may closely monitor a person’s physical and mental health throughout pregnancy and, after delivery, pay particular attention to signs of perinatal or postpartum depression.\n\n\n\nCertain medications taken during pregnancy—including some benzodiazepines, mood stabilizers, and antipsychotic medications—have been linked with birth defects, but the risks vary widely and depend on the specific medication.\n\n\n\nAntidepressants, especially SSRIs, are generally considered safe for use during pregnancy. Antidepressant medications can cross into the placenta and may reach the fetus, but the risk of birth defects and other problems is very low. Some studies have found an association between third-trimester SSRI exposure and certain symptoms, including breathing problems, in newborns. However, the \nFDA does not find sufficient evidence for a causal link: https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-drug-safety-communication-selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitor-ssri-antidepressant-use-during \n \n and recommends that health care providers treat depression during pregnancy according to the person’s specific needs.\n\n\n\nVisit the FDA website for \nmore information about medications and pregnancy: https://www.fda.gov/consumers/free-publications-women/medicine-and-pregnancy \n \n.\n\n\n\n\n"},

La salud mental es más que la ausencia de una enfermedad mental y es esencial tanto para su salud en general como para su calidad de vida. El autocuidado puede ser clave para mantener su salud mental y servir de apoyo para su tratamiento y recuperación, en caso de que tenga alguna enfermedad mental.\n\n\n"},
{"title": "El cuidado de su salud mental", "heading": "Acerca del autocuidado", "text": "\n  \nAcerca del autocuidado\n\n  \n    \n\nEsto significa dedicar tiempo a hacer cosas que le ayudan a vivir bien y a mejorar su salud física y mental. Cuando se trata de su salud mental, el autocuidado puede ayudarle a controlar el estrés, disminuir su riesgo de contraer enfermedades y aumentar su nivel de energía. Hasta algunas acciones pequeñas para dedicar un poco de tiempo a sí mismo en la vida diaria pueden generar un gran impacto.\n\n\nLos siguientes son algunos consejos para ayudarle a comenzar a cuidarse a sí mismo:\n\n\nHaga ejercicio con regularidad.\n Tan solo 30 minutos de caminatas diarias pueden ayudarle a mejorar su estado de ánimo y su salud. Si no puede hacer 30 minutos de una sola vez, ¡no se desanime! Haga pequeñas cantidades de ejercicio durante el día y estas se irán sumando.\n\n\nConsuma alimentos saludables y comidas con regularidad, y manténgase hidratado.\n Una dieta balanceada y mucha agua pueden aumentar su nivel de energía y de atención a lo largo del día. Asimismo, limite el consumo de bebidas con cafeína, como refrescos gaseosos o café.\n\n\nDele importancia al sueño. \nEstablezca un horario y asegúrese de dormir suficiente tiempo. La luz azul que emiten diversos dispositivos y pantallas puede hacer que sea más difícil conciliar el sueño. Por eso, reduzca su grado de exposición a la luz azul de su teléfono o de su computadora antes de que llegue la hora de dormir.\n\n\nIntente practicar una actividad relajante.\n Explore diversos programas o aplicaciones móviles de relajación o bienestar que podrían incorporar meditación, relajación muscular o ejercicios de respiración. Programe un horario regular para estas y otras actividades saludables que disfrute, como escribir en un diario.\n\n\nEstablezca metas y prioridades.\n Decida lo que debe hacerse en este momento y lo que puede esperar. Aprenda a decir “no” a nuevas tareas si empieza a sentir que está asumiendo demasiadas cosas. Intente tener presente lo que ha logrado al final del día, en lugar de lo que no ha podido hacer.\n\n\nPractique la gratitud.\n Recuerde diariamente cosas por las que está agradecido. Sea específico. Escríbalas durante la noche o repítalas mentalmente.\n\n\nCentre su atención en las cosas positivas\n. Identifique y cuestione sus pensamientos negativos y poco útiles.\n\n\nManténgase en contacto.\n Comuníquese con sus amigos o familiares que puedan ofrecerle apoyo emocional y ayuda práctica.\n\n\nEl autocuidado es diferente para todos y es importante descubrir qué es lo que usted necesita y disfruta. Podría ser necesario intentar diferentes cosas hasta descubrir qué funciona mejor para usted. Además, si bien el autocuidado no es una cura para las enfermedades mentales, comprender qué ocasiona o desencadena sus síntomas leves y qué técnicas de afrontamiento le funcionan le puede ayudar a cuidar su salud mental.\n\n\nPara consultar otras ideas saludables para su mente y cuerpo, así como para su entorno y sus relaciones, refiérase a las \nherramientas de bienestar de los Institutos Nacionales de Salud: https://salud.nih.gov/recursos-de-salud/herramientas-de-bienestar/ \n \n (NIH, por sus siglas en inglés).\n\n\n"},

It affects how we think, feel, act, make choices, and relate to others. Mental health is more than the absence of a mental illness—it’s essential to your overall health and quality of life. Self-care can play a role in maintaining your mental health and help support your treatment and recovery if you have a mental illness.\n\n"},
{"title": "Caring for Your Mental Health", "heading": "About Self-Care", "text": "\n  \nAbout Self-Care\n\n  \n    \n\nSelf-care means taking the time to do things that help you live well and improve both your physical health and mental health. When it comes to your mental health, self-care can help you manage stress, lower your risk of illness, and increase your energy. Even small acts of self-care in your daily life can have a big impact.\n\n\nHere are some tips to help you get started with self-care:\n\n\nGet regular exercise.\n Just 30 minutes of walking every day can help boost your mood and improve your health. Small amounts of exercise add up, so don’t be discouraged if you can’t do 30 minutes at one time.\n\n\nEat healthy, regular meals and stay hydrated.\n A balanced diet and plenty of water can improve your energy and focus throughout the day. Also, limit caffeinated beverages such as soft drinks or coffee.\n\n\nMake sleep a priority\n. Stick to a schedule, and make sure you’re getting enough sleep. Blue light from devices and screens can make it harder to fall asleep, so reduce blue light exposure from your phone or computer before bedtime.\n\n\nTry a relaxing activity.\n Explore relaxation or wellness programs or apps, which may incorporate meditation, muscle relaxation, or breathing exercises. Schedule regular times for these and other healthy activities you enjoy such as journaling.\n\n\nSet goals and priorities.\n Decide what must get done now and what can wait. Learn to say “no” to new tasks if you start to feel like you’re taking on too much. Try to be mindful of what you have accomplished at the end of the day, not what you have been unable to do.\n\n\nPractice gratitude.\n Remind yourself daily of things you are grateful for. Be specific. Write them down at night, or replay them in your mind.\n\n\nFocus on positivity\n. Identify and challenge your negative and unhelpful thoughts.\n\n\nStay connected.\n Reach out to your friends or family members who can provide emotional support and practical help.\n\n\nSelf-care looks different for everyone, and it is important to find what you need and enjoy. It may take trial and error to discover what works best for you. In addition, although self-care is not a cure for mental illnesses, understanding what causes or triggers your mild symptoms and what coping techniques work for you can help manage your mental health.\n\n\nFor other ideas for healthy practices for your mind, body, surroundings, and relationships, see the \nNational Institutes of Health (NIH) Wellness Toolkits: https://www.nih.gov/health-information/your-healthiest-self-wellness-toolkits \n \n.\n\n\n"},

Traumatic events can include experiences such as natural disasters (such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and floods), acts of violence (such as assault, abuse, terror attacks, and mass shootings), and car crashes or other accidents.\n\n\n\nIt is natural to feel afraid during and after a traumatic situation. Fear is a part of the body’s “fight-or-flight” response, which helps us avoid or respond to potential danger. People may experience a range of reactions after trauma, including:\n\n\n\nFeeling anxious, sad, or angry\n\n\t\nTrouble concentrating and sleeping\n\n\t\nContinually thinking about what happened\n\n\nMost people will recover from these symptoms, and their reactions will lessen over time. Those who continue to experience symptoms may be diagnosed with \npost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd \n\n.\n\n\n\nIt is important to seek professional help if symptoms do not improve over time or begin to interfere with daily life. Some signs that a person may need help include:\n\n\n\nWorrying a lot or feeling very anxious, sad, or fearful\n\n\t\nCrying often\n\n\t\nHaving trouble thinking clearly\n\n\t\nHaving frightening thoughts or flashbacks, reliving the experience\n\n\t\nFeeling angry, resentful, or irritable\n\n\t\nHaving nightmares or difficulty sleeping\n\n\t\nAvoiding places or people that bring back disturbing memories and responses\n\n\t\nBecoming isolated from family and friends\n\n\nPhysical responses to trauma may also mean that a person needs help. Physical symptoms may include:\n\n\n\nHaving headaches\n\n\t\nHaving stomach pain and digestive issues\n\n\t\nHaving difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep\n\n\t\nHaving a racing heart and sweating\n\n\t\nBeing very jumpy and easily startled\n\n\nPeople who have a personal or family history of mental illness or substance use: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/substance-use-and-mental-health \n, who have had previous exposure to traumatic experiences, who face ongoing stress or trauma (such as abuse), or who lack support from friends and family may be more likely to develop more severe symptoms and need additional help.\n\n\n\nPeople who experience traumatic events also may experience \npanic disorder: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/anxiety-disorders \n\n, \ndepression: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/depression \n\n, \nsubstance use: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/substance-use-and-mental-health \n\n, or \nsuicidal thoughts: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/suicide-prevention \n\n.

Si bien hacer esto no es fácil, preguntarle a la persona en riesgo si tiene algún plan de hacerse daño y desactivar o eliminar cualquier medio letal puede marcar la diferencia.\nESTÉ PRESENTE:\n Escuche atentamente para enterarse de lo que la persona en riesgo está pensando y sintiendo. De hecho, las investigaciones sugieren que reconocer y hablar sobre el suicidio puede reducir los pensamientos suicidas en lugar de aumentarlos.\nAYÚDELA A ESTABLECER UNA CONEXIÓN:\n Guarde el número de la Línea de Prevención del Suicidio y Crisis (\n988\n) en su teléfono celular para que los tenga a mano cuando los necesite.

El comportamiento suicida es complejo y no hay solo una causa que lo origina. Los principales factores de riesgo son:\ndepresión u otros trastornos mentales o de consumo de sustancias;\ndolor crónico;\nhistorial personal de intentos de suicidio anteriores;\nantecedentes familiares de trastornos mentales o de consumo de sustancias;\nantecedentes familiares de suicidio;\nexposición a violencia familiar, incluido el maltrato físico o abuso sexual;\npresencia de pistolas u otras armas de fuego en el hogar;\nlibertad reciente de un reclusorio o una cárcel;\nexposición, ya sea directa o indirectamente, a comportamientos suicidas de otros, como de sus familiares o compañeros, o de alguna celebridad.\nPara personas con pensamientos suicidas, la exposición, ya sea directa o indirectamente, a comportamientos suicidas de otros, como de sus familiares o compañeros, o de alguna celebridad también puede ser un factor de riesgo.\nLa mayoría de las personas que tienen factores de riesgo de suicidio no intentarán suicidarse, pero es difícil saber quién actuará sobre sus pensamientos suicidas. Aunque es importante tener en cuenta los factores de riesgo de suicidio, una persona que activamente muestra signos de advertencia de querer quitarse la vida puede tener un mayor riesgo de correr peligro y necesitar atención inmediata.\nLos eventos estresantes de la vida (como la pérdida de un ser querido, problemas legales o dificultades financieras) y los factores estresantes interpersonales (como vergüenza, acoso, intimidación, discriminación o problemas en las relaciones) pueden contribuir a la posibilidad de suicidarse, especialmente si ocurren conjuntamente con factores de riesgo de suicidio.\nA menudo, los familiares y amigos son los primeros en reconocer \nlos signos de advertencia sobre el suicidio: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/espanol/senales-de-advertencia-sobre-el-suicidio \n\n y ellos pueden dar el primer paso para ayudar a un ser querido encontrar tratamiento de salud mental.

Se descubrió que la evaluación de todos los pacientes, independientemente del motivo por el que llegaron a la sala de emergencias, duplicó el número de pacientes que se pudieron identificar como en riesgo de suicidio. Los investigadores calcularon que las herramientas de detección del riesgo de suicidio han logrado identificar a más de tres millones de adultos adicionales que corren peligro de suicidarse cada año.\nPredicción del riesgo de suicidio con el uso de registros electrónicos de salud: \nLos investigadores del NIMH se asociaron con el Departamento de Asuntos de los Veteranos (VA, por sus siglas en inglés) y otras entidades para desarrollar programas de cómputo que podrían ayudar a predecir el riesgo de suicidio entre los veteranos de las fuerzas armadas que reciben servicios de atención de salud en el VA.

Los pacientes trabajan con un proveedor de cuidados de la salud para elaborar un plan que describe formas de limitar acceso a medios letales como armas de fuego, pastillas o venenos. El plan también enumera varias estrategias de afrontamiento, así como personas o recursos que pueden ayudar en una crisis.\nLlamadas de seguimiento\n:\n \nHay investigaciones que han demostrado que el peligro de suicidarse disminuye en los pacientes en riesgo, cuando reciben un seguimiento subsiguiente, una intervención en el plan de seguridad y una serie de llamadas de apoyo.\nPsicoterapias\nSe ha descubierto que los tipos de intervenciones psicosociales, descritos a continuación, ayudan a las personas que han intentado suicidarse y pueden evitar que hagan otro intento de suicidarse.\nLa \nterapia cognitivo conductual\n puede ayudar a las personas a aprender nuevas formas de sobrellevar experiencias estresantes. Este tipo de terapia ayuda a las personas a reconocer sus patrones de pensamiento y a contemplar acciones alternativas cuando surgen pensamientos sobre el suicidio.\nLa \nterapia dialéctica conductual\n ha demostrado que reduce conductas suicidas en los adolescentes. También ha quedado comprobado que este tipo de terapia reduce la tasa de intentos de suicidio en adultos con trastorno límite de la personalidad, una enfermedad mental caracterizada por un patrón continuo de estados de ánimo, autoimagen y conductas inestables que a menudo dan origen a acciones impulsivas y a problemas en las relaciones. Un terapeuta capacitado en este tipo de terapia puede ayudar a la persona a reconocer cuando sus sentimientos o acciones son perturbadores o poco saludables, y le enseña destrezas que pueden ayudarles a sobrellevar de mejor manera las situaciones desagradables..\nMedicamentos\nLos medicamentos pueden beneficiar a algunas personas en riesgo de suicidio. Las personas pueden colaborar con sus proveedores de atención médica mejor medicamento, o una combinación de estos, así como la dosis adecuada. A menudo, muchas personas en riesgo de suicidio tienen alguna enfermedad mental o problema de abuso de sustancias, y pueden beneficiarse de tomar medicamentos al mismo tiempo que reciben una intervención psicosocial.\nLa clozapina es un medicamento antipsicótico que se usa primordialmente para tratar a persona con esquizofrenia. A la fecha, es el único medicamento con una \nindicación específica de la Administración de Alimentos y Medicamentos de los Estados Unidos (FDA, por sus siglas en inglés): http://www.fda.gov/drugs/drugsafety/postmarketdrugsafetyinformationforpatientsandproviders/ucm497790.htm \n \n  para reducir el riesgo de comportamientos suicidas recurrentes en pacientes con esquizofrenia o un trastorno esquizoafectivo (en inglés). \nSi le han recetado un medicamento, es importante que:\nHable con un proveedor de atención médica para cerciorarse de que comprende los riesgos y los beneficios del medicamento que está tomando.\nNo deje de tomar un medicamento sin antes hablar con su médico u otro proveedor de atención médica. Dejar de tomar repentinamente un medicamente puede hacer que los síntomas empeoren. También es posible que surjan otros efectos de abstinencia molestos o posiblemente peligrosos.\nInforme a un proveedor de atención médica de inmediato sobre cualquier preocupación por los efectos secundarios. Este profesional puede ayudar a determinar si necesita cambiar la dosis o tomar un medicamento diferente.\nNotifique cualquier efecto secundario grave a \nMedWatch, el programa de la FDA para reportar eventos adversos: https://www.fda.gov/safety/reporting-serious-problems-fda/como-los-consumidores-pueden-reportar-eventos-adversos-o-problemas-serios-la-fda \n \n, ya sea en línea o llamando al 1-800-332-1088.

Un administrador de atención de la salud conductual trabajará en coordinación con la persona, su proveedor de atención primaria y los especialistas en salud mental para establecer un plan de tratamiento. Se ha demostrado que la atención colaborativa es una forma eficaz de tratar la depresión y reducir los pensamientos suicidas.\n\n"},

DSM-IV mental disorders were assessed using a modified version of the fully structured World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WMH-CIDI), a fully structured lay-administered diagnostic interview that generates both International Classification of Diseases, 10\nth\n Revision, and DSM-IV diagnoses. The DSM-IV criteria were used here. The Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) assessed disability in work role performance, household maintenance, social life, and intimate relationships on a 0–10 scale. Participants for the main interview totaled 9,282 English-speaking, non-institutionalized, civilian respondents. The NCS-R was led by Harvard University.\n\n\nSurvey Non-response:\n\n\n\n\n    \nIn 2001-2002, non-response was 29.1% of primary respondents and 19.6% of secondary respondents.\n\n    \n\n\nReasons for non-response to interviewing include: refusal to participate (7.3% of primary, 6.3% of secondary); respondent was reluctant- too busy but did not refuse (17.7% of primary, 11.6% of secondary); circumstantial, such as intellectual developmental disability or overseas work assignment (2.0% of primary, 1.7% of secondary); and household units that were never contacted (2.0).\n\n  \nFor more information, see \nPMID: 15297905: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15297905 \n \n.\n\n\nNational Comorbidity Survey Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A)\n\n\n\nDiagnostic Assessment and Population:\n\n\n\nThe NCS-A was carried out under a cooperative agreement sponsored by NIMH to meet a request from Congress to provide national data on the prevalence and correlates of mental disorders among U.S. youth. The NCS-A was a nationally representative, face-to-face survey of 10,123 adolescents aged 13 to 18 years in the continental United States. The survey was based on a dual-frame design that included 904 adolescent residents of the households that participated in the adult U.S. National Comorbidity Survey Replication and 9,244 adolescent students selected from a nationally representative sample of 320 schools.

This is made up of non-response rates of 14.1% in the household sample, 18.2% in the un-blinded school sample, and 77.7% in the blinded school sample. Non-response was largely due to refusal (21.3%), which in the household and un-blinded school samples came largely from parents rather than adolescents (72.3% and 81.0%, respectively). The refusals in the blinded school sample, in comparison, came almost entirely (98.1%) from parents failing to return the signed consent postcard.\n\n  \nFor more information, see \nPMID: 19507169: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19507169 \n \n.\n\n\n\n"},

These therapies act by activating or inhibiting the brain with electricity. The electricity can be given directly through electrodes implanted in the brain or indirectly through electrodes placed on the scalp. The electricity can also be induced by applying magnetic fields to the head.\n\n\n\nThis video from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) provides an overview of brain stimulation therapies and how they can be used to treat mental disorders.\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n\n            \n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\nThis page provides basic information about brain stimulation therapies. It does not cover all forms of therapy or all mental disorders for which a therapy might be used. The information should not be used as a guide for making medical decisions. Research is ongoing to determine the best use of these therapies and if they are effective treatments for other disorders and conditions.\n\n\n\nThe page is divided into therapies that are authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat specific mental disorders, including depression, bipolar disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), versus therapies that are newer and still considered experimental.\n\n\n\nThe authorized therapies covered on this page are:\n\n\n\nElectroconvulsive therapy\n\n\t\nRepetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation\n\n\t\nVagus nerve stimulation\n\n\nThe experimental therapies covered on this page are:\n\n\n\nMagnetic seizure therapy\n\n\t\nDeep brain stimulation\n\n\nOther brain stimulation therapies not discussed here may also hold promise for treating mental disorders. Information about these therapies is updated frequently. See the \nFDA website: https://www.fda.gov/ \n \n for the latest information, warnings, and guidance on brain stimulation devices and announcements about new ones.\n\n\n"},
{"title": "Brain Stimulation Therapies", "heading": "How do brain stimulation therapies work? ", "text": "\n  \nHow do brain stimulation therapies work? \n\n  \n    \nIn most cases, brain stimulation therapy is used only after other treatments have been tried. Although brain stimulation therapies are less frequently used than \nmedication: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/mental-health-medications \n\n or \npsychotherapy: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/psychotherapies \n\n, they hold promise for people with certain mental disorders who have not responded to other treatments.\n\n\n\nBrain stimulation therapies should be prescribed and monitored by a health care provider with specific training and expertise. A trained medical team performs the therapies. Most of the therapies involve using anesthesia to sedate the patient and a muscle relaxant to prevent them from moving. If so, an anesthesiologist will monitor breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure throughout the procedure.\n\n\n\nA treatment plan involving brain stimulation therapy is based on a person's individual needs and medical situation. It usually also includes medication: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/mental-health-medications \n, psychotherapy: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/psychotherapies \n, or both. Patients will likely be advised to continue these other treatments during and after therapy to maintain clinical improvement. Patients should not stop a treatment unless specifically advised by a health care provider.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrain stimulation therapies treat serious mental illnesses. They are often used when a person with a serious mental illness is experiencing dangerous circumstances, such as not responding to the outside world or being at risk of harming themselves. If you or someone you know is struggling or having thoughts of suicide, call or text the \n988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline: https://988lifeline.org: https://988lifeline.org/chat/ \n/ \n\n \n at \n988 \nor\n \nchat at \n988lifeline.org: https://988lifeline.org/chat/ \n\n \n. In life-threatening situations, call \n911\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorized therapies\n\n\n\nThe FDA determines whether foods, drugs, medical devices, and other products are safe to use. The FDA commonly gives two types of authorization to devices like brain stimulation therapies.\n\n\n\nApproved means that the FDA has decided that the benefits of the device outweigh the known risks, as demonstrated by the results of clinical testing. Approval is usually required for devices that might have a significant risk of injury or illness, including devices implanted in the body.\n\n\t\nCleared means that the device is substantially equivalent to a similar device that the FDA has already cleared or approved. Clearance is usually given to lower-risk devices used outside of the body.\n\n\n\n"},

In some cases, ECT has also been used to treat schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and mania.\nECT is usually considered only if a person’s illness has not improved after trying other treatments like medication or psychotherapy. To be eligible for ECT, a person must have severe, treatment-resistant depression or require a rapid response due to life-threatening circumstances, such as being unable to move or respond to the outside world (e.g., is catatonic), being suicidal, or being malnourished.\nECT can be effective when medications have not worked, cannot be tolerated, or are undesirable due to physical illness, which is often the case in older adults. ECT also begins working more rapidly than antidepressant medications, usually taking effect within the first week of treatment.\nECT: How it works\nBefore a doctor performs ECT, the patient is sedated with a short-acting general anesthetic and given an intravenous muscle relaxant to prevent movement.\nDuring the procedure:\nElectrodes are placed at precise locations on the patient’s head.\nAn electric current is sent through the electrodes into the brain, causing seizure activity that lasts under a minute. Anesthesia ensures that the patient does not experience pain or feel the electrical pulses. Often, a blood pressure cuff is used on an arm or leg to block the muscle relaxant and allow movement of that limb to confirm that the seizure activity is adequate.\nThe patient awakens 5–10 minutes after the procedure ends. They may feel groggy at first as the anesthesia wears off, but after about an hour, they are usually alert and can resume normal activities.\nA typical course of ECT is administered three times a week until a patient's symptoms improve (usually within 6–12 treatments). Frequently, a patient who undergoes ECT also takes antidepressant or mood-stabilizing medication.\nAlthough ECT is effective in treating depressive episodes, follow-up treatment—either antidepressant medication or \nmaintenance ECT: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29419559/ \n \n—is usually required to sustain clinical improvement and reduce the chances that symptoms return. Maintenance ECT varies depending on the patient’s needs and may range from one session per week to one session every few months.\nECT: Side effects\nThe most common side effects associated with ECT include the following:\nHeadaches\nUpset stomach\nMuscle aches\nMemory loss\nDisorientation or confusion\nSome patients may experience memory loss, especially of memories around the time of treatment. Sometimes the memory problems are more severe, but usually they improve over the days and weeks following the end of an ECT course.\nResearch has found that \nmemory problems are more common: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6472304/ \n \n with the traditional form of ECT, known as bilateral ECT, in which electrodes are placed on both sides of the head. In comparison, unilateral ECT involves placing an electrode on only one side of the head, typically the right side, because it is opposite the brain's learning and memory areas, with another electrode placed on top of the head. Many doctors, patients, and families prefer unilateral ECT because it is less likely to cause memory problems.\nModern ECT devices can deliver electrical signals using brief or ultra-brief pulses. These short pulses are as effective as the traditional form of ECT but are given at a lower dose, helping further reduce cognitive side effects.\n\n"},

The magnetic field it creates is about the same strength as an MRI scan.\nrTMS: Why it’s done\nSeveral rTMS devices have been cleared to treat specific mental disorders. The \nFDA cleared the first rTMS device in 2008 for depression: https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/guidance-documents-medical-devices-and-radiation-emitting-products/repetitive-transcranial-magnetic-stimulation-rtms-systems-class-ii-special-controls-guidance \n \n in people who did not respond to at least one antidepressant medication in the current depressive episode. Although ECT is still considered the \"gold standard\" for treatment-resistant depression, strong clinical evidence supports the effectiveness of rTMS in reducing depressive symptoms. rTMS is now used to treat moderate-to-severe depression in cases where medications have proven ineffective or intolerable.\nSince 2008, rTMS has been cleared to treat several types of depression, including depression with comorbid anxiety and depression with suicidality. In 2018, the \nFDA also cleared rTMS for severe OCD: https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-permits-marketing-transcranial-magnetic-stimulation-treatment-obsessive-compulsive-disorder \n \n.\nMore recently, the \nFDA cleared a rapid-acting form of rTMS for treatment-resistant depression: https://alert.psychnews.org/2022/09/fda-clears-novel-rapid-acting-tms.html \n\n \n. Accelerated protocols that act more quickly than standard rTMS show similar effectiveness while shortening treatment length. Thus, patients benefit from receiving an entire course of treatment in much less time and getting relief from their symptoms more rapidly.\nNewer forms of rTMS: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33834408/ \n \n involving magnetic pulses with other parameters are also under investigation to treat depression, OCD, and other mental disorders.\nrTMS: How it works\nRather than electric currents, rTMS uses low-intensity magnetic pulses to stimulate the brain. Unlike ECT, in which stimulation is generalized, in rTMS, magnetic stimulation is targeted to a specific brain site. Also, in contrast to ECT, the procedure does not require anesthesia and can be performed in a clinical or office setting.\nA typical rTMS session lasts 30–60 minutes. A typical course of rTMS treatment consists of daily sessions 5 days per week for 4–6 weeks.\nAccelerated rTMS protocols: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7674552/ \n \n work much faster (within seconds to minutes). In this case, multiple sessions are delivered on a single day, with short breaks in between.\nDuring the procedure:\nAn electromagnetic coil is held against the head near an area of the brain thought to be involved in mood regulation, cognitive control, or both. These brain areas include the left prefrontal cortex (for depression) and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex or anterior cingulate cortex (for OCD). In deep TMS, two coils may be used to deliver more stimulation to the region and target larger structures deep in the brain.\nShort electromagnetic pulses are repeatedly administered through the coil or coils. The patient usually feels a slight knocking or tapping on the head as the pulses are administered.\nThe magnetic pulses pass easily through the skull and cause small electric currents that stimulate nerve cells in the targeted brain region.\nThere is not consensus on the best way to position the coil on the head or deliver the electromagnetic pulses. It has also yet to be determined if rTMS works best when delivered as a single treatment or when combined with medication, psychotherapy, or both. Research is underway to establish the safest and most effective uses of rTMS, the optimal brain sites to target, and the best follow-up approach to sustain clinical improvement.\nrTMS: Side effects\nOverall, rTMS is \nsafe and well tolerated: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5925584/ \n \n by patients. But, like all therapies described here, it can have side effects. These include the following:\nDiscomfort at the site on the head where the magnet is placed\nContraction or tingling of scalp, jaw, or face muscles during the procedure\nMild headaches or brief lightheadedness\nDizziness\nUsing magnetic pulses and targeting a specific brain site results in milder stimulation than in ECT, avoiding most seizure activity. Although it is possible for the procedure to cause seizures, a \ncomprehensive review: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7732158/ \n \n found that the risk is rare. Most side effects appear to be mild and short-term when \nexpert guidelines: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9094636/ \n \n are followed.\nLong-term side effects have not been determined, and more research is needed to establish the long-term safety of rTMS.\n\n"},
{"title": "Brain Stimulation Therapies", "heading": "What is vagus nerve stimulation?", "text": "\n  \nWhat is vagus nerve stimulation?\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n            \n  \nVagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a surgical procedure that involves a device implanted under the skin. The device sends electrical pulses through the left vagus nerve that runs from the brainstem through the neck and down the side of the chest and abdomen. The nerve carries messages from the brain to the body's major organs, including the heart, lungs, and intestines, and between areas of the brain that control mood, sleep, and other functions.\nMore recently, this therapy has been simplified by the introduction of noninvasive VNS (known as \ntranscutaneous VNS [tVNS]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7199464/ \n \n). tVNS uses a portable device to send electrical stimulation through the skin to activate the vagus nerve. Although tVNS is still experimental, the approach may offer advantages over surgical VNS, such as greater accessibility and affordability, while avoiding surgical complications.\nVNS: Why it’s done\nVNS was initially developed as a treatment for epilepsy. Research using brain scans showed that the procedure also affected areas of the brain involved in mood regulation, with favorable effects on depression symptoms.\nIn 2005, the \nFDA approved surgical VNS for depression: https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpma/pma.cfm?id=P970003S050 \n \n when the following conditions are met:\nThe patient is 18 years of age and older.\nThe depression has lasted 2 or more years.\nThe depression is severe or recurrent.\nThe depression has not eased after trying at least four other treatments.\nDespite FDA approval for depression, VNS is not intended as a first-line treatment and remains infrequently used. The results of studies examining its effectiveness for depression have been mixed. Whereas a \nreview of clinical trials: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35158102/ \n \n of VNS for treatment-resistant depression found a sustained reduction in depression symptoms and enhanced quality of life, \nother studies: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32677482/ \n \n did not report meaningful improvements.\nAlthough noninvasive forms of VNS have also shown \nantidepressant effects: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7563188/ \n \n, tVNS is not authorized by the FDA as a treatment for depression. However, a portable VNS device has been \ncleared by the FDA to treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/evren-technologies-receives-fda-breakthrough-device-designation-for-the-phoenix---revolutionary-transcutaneous-auricular-vagus-nerve-therapy-to-treat-ptsd-301341288.html \n\n \n under a Breakthrough Device Designation, given to medical devices with preliminary evidence of clinical effectiveness compared to other available treatments. Research is ongoing to test the efficacy and safety of tVNS for depression, PTSD, and other mental disorders.\nVNS: How it works\nVNS is traditionally a surgical procedure.\nA device about the size of a stopwatch called a pulse generator is implanted in the upper left side of the chest while the patient is under anesthesia.\nConnected to the pulse generator is an electrical lead wire, which is then connected from the generator to the left vagus nerve.\nTypically, 30-second electrical pulses are sent every five minutes from the generator to the vagus nerve. The duration and frequency of the pulses may vary depending on how the generator is programmed.\nThe vagus nerve, in turn, delivers those electrical signals to the brain.\nThe pulse generator, which operates continuously, is powered by a battery that lasts around 10 years, after which it must be replaced. Patients usually do not feel pain or discomfort as the device operates.\nIt may be several months before a patient notices any benefits, and not all patients respond to VNS. Some patients have no improvement in symptoms, and some may get worse.\nThe device can be temporarily deactivated by placing a magnet over the chest where the generator is implanted. A patient may want to deactivate the device if side effects become intolerable or before engaging in strenuous activity or exercise because it can interfere with breathing. The device reactivates when the magnet is removed.\nNoninvasive forms of VNS consist of a device worn around the neck or ears or a handheld device. There are many questions about the most effective stimulation sites, parameters, and protocols for tVNS, and research is ongoing to determine the optimal conditions to achieve the greatest clinical benefits.\nVNS: Side effects\nVNS is not without risk. There may be complications, such as infection or pain from the implant surgery, or the device may come loose, move around, or malfunction, all of which can require additional surgery to correct.\nOther potential side effects include the following:\nDiscomfort or tingling in the area where the device is implanted\nVoice changes or hoarseness\nCough or sore throat\nNeck pain or headaches\nBreathing problems, especially during exercise\nDifficulty swallowing\nNausea or vomiting\nIf cleared by the FDA, tVNS devices may help overcome some of these surgical issues. Nonetheless, mild side effects of tVNS have been reported, including:\nTingling, pain, or itchiness around the stimulation site\nNausea or vomiting\nDizziness\nThe long-term side effects of all forms of VNS are unknown.\nExperimental therapies\nOther brain stimulation therapies are actively being explored for specific mental disorders. The following therapies are still considered experimental and have not yet been authorized by the FDA to treat mental disorders.\n\n"},

The seizures are targeted to a specific site in the brain.\nIn the United States, MST is available only as part of a clinical trial or research study. NIMH has information for people interested in \njoining a clinical trial of MST or another brain stimulation therapy: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/trials#part_8610 \n\n.\nMST: How it works\nMST combines aspects of both ECT and rTMS. Like rTMS, MST uses magnetic pulses to stimulate a specific brain site. The pulses are given at a higher intensity and frequency than in rTMS to induce a seizure. Like in ECT, the patient is anesthetized and given a muscle relaxant to prevent movement during the procedure. The goal is to retain the effectiveness of ECT while reducing the risk of cognitive side effects.\nDuring the procedure:\nAn electromagnetic coil is held against the head, typically targeting the brain’s prefrontal area.\nRapidly alternating strong magnetic pulses pass through the coil into the brain to induce a seizure. Anesthesia is used to ensure that the patient does not experience pain or feel the electrical pulses.\nThe magnetic dosage is individualized for each patient by finding the patient-specific seizure threshold.\nThere is not agreement on MST's optimal dosing, coil size, and stimulation site, and researchers are actively conducting studies to determine those specifications.\nMST: Why it’s done\nIntroduced in 2001, MST is currently in the early stages of investigation and clinical use for treating mental disorders. A \nreview of randomized clinical trials: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6493152/ \n \n examining MST for treatment-resistant depression showed promising results. However, more confirmatory evidence is needed to draw conclusions about MST’s effectiveness in treating depression and other mental disorders.\nMST: Side effects\nLike ECT, MST carries the risk of side effects caused by anesthesia and the induction of a seizure. These side effects can include the following:\nHeadaches or scalp pain\nDizziness\nNausea or vomiting\nMuscle aches or fatigue\nA \nsystematic review and meta-analysis: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8380249/ \n \n found that MST produced fewer memory problems and other cognitive side effects and caused less confusion and shorter seizures compared to ECT.\n\n"},

Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) mental disorders were assessed using a modified version of the fully structured World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WMH-CIDI), a fully structured lay-administered diagnostic interview that generates both International Classification of Diseases, 10\nth\n Revision, and DSM-IV diagnoses. The DSM-IV criteria were used here. The Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) assessed disability in work role performance, household maintenance, social life, and intimate relationships on a 0–10 scale. Participants for the main interview totaled 9,282 English-speaking, non-institutionalized, civilian respondents. Any anxiety disorder was assessed in a subsample of 5,692 adults. The NCS-R was led by Harvard University.\n\n  \nUnlike the DSM-IV criteria used in the NCS-R and NCS-A, the current DSM-5 no longer places post-traumatic stress disorder or obsessive compulsive disorder in the anxiety disorder category. They are listed in new DSM5 categories.\n\n\nSurvey Non-response:\n\n\n\nIn 2001-2002, non-response was 29.1% of primary respondents and 19.6% of secondary respondents.\n\n  \nReasons for non-response to interviewing include: refusal to participate (7.3% of primary, 6.3% of secondary); respondent was reluctant- too busy but did not refuse (17.7% of primary, 11.6% of secondary); circumstantial, such as intellectual developmental disability or overseas work assignment (2.0% of primary, 1.7% of secondary); and household units that were never contacted (2.0).\n\n  \nFor more information, see \nPMID: 15297905: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15297905 \n \n.\n\n\nNational Comorbidity Survey Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A)\n\n\n\nDiagnostic Assessment and Population:\n\n\n\nThe NCS-A was carried out under a cooperative agreement sponsored by NIMH to meet a request from Congress to provide national data on the prevalence and correlates of mental disorders among U.S. youth. The NCS-A was a nationally representative, face-to-face survey of 10,123 adolescents aged 13 to 18 years in the continental United States. The survey was based on a dual-frame design that included 904 adolescent residents of the households that participated in the adult U.S. National Comorbidity Survey Replication and 9,244 adolescent students selected from a nationally representative sample of 320 schools. The survey was fielded between February 2001 and January 2004. DSM-IV mental disorders were assessed using a modified version of the fully structured World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview.\n\n\nSurvey Non-response:\n\n\n\nThe overall adolescent non-response rate was 24.4%. This is made up of non-response rates of 14.1% in the household sample, 18.2% in the un-blinded school sample, and 77.7% in the blinded school sample. Non-response was largely due to refusal (21.3%), which in the household and un-blinded school samples came largely from parents rather than adolescents (72.3% and 81.0%, respectively). The refusals in the blinded school sample, in comparison, came almost entirely (98.1%) from parents failing to return the signed consent postcard.\n\n  \nFor more information, see \nPMID: 19507169: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19507169 \n \n.\n\n\n\n"},

It is available for other mental disorders only as part of a clinical trial.\nDBS: How it works\nDBS works by sending electrical pulses to specific brain areas. It requires surgery to implant electrodes in the brain. The specific brain area depends on the disorder being treated. For depression, the brain area was initially the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, which can be overactive in depression and other mood disorders, and now includes several brain areas. For OCD, the brain area is usually the ventral capsule/ventral striatum or the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis.\nPrior to the procedure, scans of the brain are taken using MRI, which the surgeon uses as a guide to determine where to place the electrodes during surgery.\nOnce a patient is ready for surgery:\nThe head is numbed with a local anesthetic so the patient does not feel pain.\nThe surgeon drills one or two small holes into the patient’s head; threads a thin insulated wire, usually a pair of wires, through the hole(s) and into the brain; and places electrodes into a specific brain area.\nThe patient is awake while the electrodes are implanted to provide feedback on their placement but does not feel pain because the head is numbed and the brain itself does not register pain.\nAfter the electrodes are implanted, the patient is put under general anesthesia.\nThe electrodes are attached to wires that run inside the body from the head, through the neck and shoulder, and down to the chest, where a small battery-operated generator (about the size of a pacemaker) is implanted. The pulse generator is placed under the skin in the upper chest. Whereas early DBS models used two pulse generators, one wired to each of the two implanted electrodes, most newer models use a single pulse generator to stimulate both electrodes.\nFrom the pulse generator, electrical pulses are delivered through the wires to the electrodes in the brain. Stimulation is applied continuously, and its frequency and level are customized to each patient. Although it is unclear exactly how DBS works to reduce symptoms, researchers believe that the pulses help \"reset\" the malfunctioning area of the brain so that it works normally again.\nAfter the procedure, the patient may be given a device-based tool (like a hand-held controller or smart phone app) to help them monitor and manage their symptoms at home or provide feedback to their clinical care team.\nDBS: Why it's done\nDBS was first developed to treat \nmovement disorders: https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/deep-brain-stimulation-movement-disorders \n \n, including tremor and Parkinson's disease.\nThe \nFDA has since cleared DBS for severe OCD under a Humanitarian Device Exemption: https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfhde/hde.cfm?id=375533 \n \n, which is a provision for rare diseases or conditions experienced by relatively few patients among whom it has been difficult to gather evidence to demonstrate effectiveness. However, there is still much to be learned about optimizing DBS treatment. Although a \nsystematic review: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36127157/ \n \n found that DBS improves OCD symptoms, other \nreview articles: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7815503/ \n \n have called for more confirmatory evidence before drawing conclusions about its effectiveness.\nSimilarly, DBS received \nBreakthrough Device Designation from the FDA in 2022: https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/abbott-receives-fdas-breakthrough-device-designation-to-explore-use-of-deep-brain-stimulation-to-manage-severe-depression-301584792.html \n\n \n to investigate its use for treatment-resistant depression. A \nsystematic review: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36127157/ \n and meta-analysis \n showed favorable effects of DBS in treating depression symptoms. Nonetheless, it remains an experimental treatment for depression until more data from high-quality studies are available.\nDBS: Side effects\nDBS carries risks associated with any brain surgery. For example, the procedure may lead to the following:\nBleeding in the brain or stroke\nDevice-related discomfort, pain, or infection around the incision\nInfection near the incision site\nHeadaches\nDisorientation or confusion\nCognitive impairment\nLightheadedness, dizziness, nausea, or vomiting\nTrouble sleeping, agitation, or restlessness\nBecause the procedure is still being studied, other side effects not yet identified are possible.

Talk to a health care provider about clinical trials, their benefits and risks, and whether one is right for you.\n\n\n\nTo learn more or find a study, visit:\n\n\n\nResearch Conducted at NIMH: Join a Study: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-conducted-at-nimh/join-a-study \n\n\n\t\nNIMH Clinical Trials – Information for Participants: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/trials \n\n \n\n\t\nClinicalTrials.gov: Brain Stimulation Therapies: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=&term=Brain+Stimulation+Therapies+OR+Electroconvulsive+Therapy+OR+Repetitive+Transcranial+Magnetic+Stimulation+OR+Vagus+Nerve+Stimulation+OR+Magnetic+Seizure+Therapy+OR+Deep+Brain+Stimulation&cntry=&state=&city=&dist=&Search=Search&recrs=a&recrs=b&recrs=c&fund=0 \n \n\n\nTo learn more about the mental disorders discussed on this page, visit \nNIMH’s health topic webpages: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics \n\n.\n\n\n"},

The DSM-IV criteria were used here. The Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) assessed disability in work role performance, household maintenance, social life, and intimate relationships on a 0–10 scale.

This is made up of non-response rates of 14.1% in the household sample, 18.2% in the un-blinded school sample, and 77.7% in the blinded school sample. Non-response was largely due to refusal (21.3%), which in the household and un-blinded school samples came largely from parents rather than adolescents (72.3% and 81.0%, respectively).

The survey was fielded between February 2001 and January 2004. DSM-IV mental disorders were assessed using a modified version of the fully structured World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview.\n\n\nSurvey Non-response:\n\n\n\nThe overall adolescent non-response rate was 24.4%. This is made up of non-response rates of 14.1% in the household sample, 18.2% in the un-blinded school sample, and 77.7% in the blinded school sample. Non-response was largely due to refusal (21.3%), which in the household and un-blinded school samples came largely from parents rather than adolescents (72.3% and 81.0%, respectively). The refusals in the blinded school sample, in comparison, came almost entirely (98.1%) from parents failing to return the signed consent postcard.\n\n  \nFor more information, see \nPMID: 19507169: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19507169 \n \n.\n\n\n\n"},

The DSM-IV criteria were used here. The Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) assessed disability in work role performance, household maintenance, social life, and intimate relationships on a 0–10 scale. Participants for the main interview totaled 9,282 English-speaking, non-institutionalized, civilian respondents. Any anxiety disorder was assessed in a subsample of 5,692 adults. The NCS-R was led by Harvard University.\n\n  \nUnlike the DSM-IV criteria used in the NCS-R and NCS-A, the current DSM-5 no longer places post-traumatic stress disorder or obsessive compulsive disorder in the anxiety disorder category. They are listed in new DSM5 categories.\n\n\nSurvey Non-response:\n\n\n\nIn 2001-2002, non-response was 29.1% of primary respondents and 19.6% of secondary respondents.\n\n  \nReasons for non-response to interviewing include: refusal to participate (7.3% of primary, 6.3% of secondary); respondent was reluctant- too busy but did not refuse (17.7% of primary, 11.6% of secondary); circumstantial, such as intellectual developmental disability or overseas work assignment (2.0% of primary, 1.7% of secondary); and household units that were never contacted (2.0).\n    \n\n     \n\n  \nFor more information, see \nPMID: 15297905: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15297905 \n \n.\n\n\nNational Comorbidity Survey Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A)\n\n\n\nDiagnostic Assessment and Population:\n\n\n\nThe NCS-A was carried out under a cooperative agreement sponsored by NIMH to meet a request from Congress to provide national data on the prevalence and correlates of mental disorders among U.S. youth.

{"title": "Schizophrenia", "heading": "Definition", "text": "\n  \nDefinition\n\n  \n    \n\nSchizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by disruptions in thought processes, perceptions, emotional responsiveness, and social interactions. Although the course of schizophrenia varies among individuals, schizophrenia is typically persistent and can be both severe and disabling.\n\n\nSymptoms of schizophrenia include psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, and thought disorder (unusual ways of thinking), as well as reduced expression of emotions, reduced motivation to accomplish goals, difficulty in social relationships, motor impairment, and cognitive impairment. Although symptoms typically start in late adolescence or early adulthood, schizophrenia is often viewed from a developmental perspective. Cognitive impairment and unusual behaviors sometimes appear in childhood, and persistent presence of multiple symptoms represent a later stage of the disorder. This pattern may reflect disruptions in brain development as well as environmental factors such as prenatal or early life stress. This perspective fuels the hope that early interventions will improve the course of schizophrenia which is often severely disabling when left untreated. \n\n\nAdditional information can be found on the \nNIMH Health Topics page on Schizophrenia: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/schizophrenia \n\n.\n\n\n"},

Accurate assessment of schizophrenia is best achieved using clinicians trained in the diagnosis of mental illnesses. The U.S. prevalence studies cited here were selected based on their use of U.S. population samples and use of methods that involved clinical diagnosis, either via clinical reappraisal (validation) studies or clinical record studies.\n3,4,5\n\n\nIndividuals with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders may be under-counted in prevalence estimation studies. These individuals may be under-represented in household surveys because they may reside in prisons, other institutions, or may lack a permanent address. Similarly, some people with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders may not be fully reflected in medical records data because they may not have a documented diagnosis, and/or may receive little or no health care.\n\n\n\nInformation on statistical methods and measurement caveats can be found in the papers cited on this page and listed in the reference section. Below we provide additional background information for large datasets used in two studies cited on this page.\n3,5\n\n\nNational Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R)\n\n\n\nThe NCS-R is a nationally representative, face-to-face, household survey conducted between February 2001 and April 2003 with a response rate of 70.9%. DSM-IV mental disorders were assessed using a modified version of the fully structured World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WMH-CIDI), a fully structured lay-administered diagnostic interview that generates both International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, and DSM-IV diagnoses. The DSM-IV criteria were used here. Participants for the main interview totaled 9,282 English-speaking, non-institutionalized, civilian respondents. Non-affective psychosis was assessed in a subsample of 2,322 respondents.\n3\n The Sheehan Disability Scales (SDS) assessed disability in work role performance, household maintenance, social life, and intimate relationships on 0-10 scales. The NCS-R was led by Harvard University.\n\n\nSurvey non-response: In 2001-2002, non-response was 29.1% of primary respondents and 19.6% of secondary respondents. Reasons for non-response to interviewing include: refusal to participate (7.3% of primary, 6.3% of secondary); respondent was reluctant – too busy but did not refuse (17.7% of primary, 11.6% of secondary); circumstantial, such as intellectual developmental disability or overseas work assignment (2.0% of primary, 1.7% of secondary); and, household units that were never contacted (2.0%).\n\n\nFor more information, see \nPMID: 15297905: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15297905 \n \n.\n\n\nMedical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS)\n\n\n\nThe MEPS collect data from community-dwelling people in the U.S. It does not include patients living in group homes, supported living arrangements, prisons, and institutions. In addition, homeless people and undocumented immigrants are excluded. These groups may have a higher prevalence of schizophrenia. MEPS survey responses were obtained from a single respondent for all the members of the family, therefore some recall bias may be associated with the responses.\n\n  \nPatients for the schizophrenia study were selected based on ICD-9 codes only. Due to the stigma associated with the condition, physicians are known to give patients an interim non-schizophrenia diagnosis when uncertain about schizophrenia until it can be confirmed. To capture patients who may be given an interim non-schizophrenia diagnosis, researchers used the ICD-9 code for non-organic psychoses in addition to that for schizophrenic disorder in their study.\n5\n MEPS collects information about conditions through patient interviews and some miscoding may occur as the household participants describe their conditions during the interviews and the coders record the ICD-9 codes for the diagnosis.\n\n  \nFor more information, see \ndoi/10.1111/jphs.12027/epdf: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jphs.12027/epdf \n: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jphs.12027/epdf: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jphs.12027/epdf \n \n\n \n and the \nMEPS Survey Background Page: https://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/about_meps/survey_back.jsp \n \n.\n\n\n\n"},

Gender identity information was not collected in the survey.\n\n\nInterview Response and Completion:\n\n\n\nIn 2021, 53.0% of the selected NSDUH sample of people 18 or older did not complete the interview. This rate of non-response is higher than in previous years. Please see the Background on the 2021 NSDUH and the COVID-19 Pandemic section below for more information.\n\n\t\nReasons for non-response to interviewing include the following: refusal to participate (30.1%); respondent unavailable or never at home (18.8%); and other reasons such as physical/mental incompetence or language barriers (4.2%).\n\n\t\nPeople with suicidal behavior may disproportionately fall into these non-response categories. While NSDUH weighting includes non-response adjustments to reduce bias, these adjustments may not fully account for differential non-response by suicide behavior status. Prior to the 2020 NSDUH, this bias was deemed small and inconsequential due to low rates of item nonresponse and low prevalence estimates for outcomes imputed using the zero-fill method. With the increase in break-offs among adults in 2020 who completed the questionnaire via the web, the potential bias of this approach for handling missing data became of greater concern. Therefore, missing values in the variables associated with multiple outcomes, including for suicidal thoughts and behaviors, were statistically imputed beginning in 2021.\n\n\nData Suppression:\n\n\n\nFor some groups, data are not reported due to low precision. Data may be suppressed in the above charts if the data do not meet acceptable ranges for prevalence estimates, standard error estimates, and sample size.\n\n\nBackground on the 2021 NSDUH and the COVID-19 Pandemic:\n\n\n\nData collection methods for the 2021 NSDUH changed in several ways because of the COVID-19 pandemic: the 2021 NSDUH continued the use of multimode data collection procedures (both in-person and virtual data collection) that were first implemented in the fourth quarter of the 2020 NSDUH. Overall, 54.6% of interviews were completed via the web, and 45.4% were completed in person. In 2021, the weighted response rates for household screening and for interviewing were 22.2% and 46.2%, respectively, for an overall response rate of 10.3% for people aged 12 or older. Given the use of multimode data collection procedures through the entirety of the collection year and the rate of non-response, comparison of estimates from the 2021 NSDUH with those from prior years must be made with caution.\n\n\nPlease see the \n2021 National Survey on Drug Use and Health Methodological Summary and Definitions report: https://www.samhsa.gov/data/report/2021-methodological-summary-and-definitions \n \n for further information on how these data were collected and calculated.\n\n\n\nLast Updated: May 2023\n\n\n"},

Events that may lead to PTSD include, but are not limited to, violent personal assaults, natural or human-caused disasters, accidents, combat, and other forms of violence. Exposure to events like these is common. About one half of all U.S. adults will experience at least one traumatic event in their lives, but most do not develop PTSD. People who experience PTSD may have persistent, frightening thoughts and memories of the event(s), experience sleep problems, feel detached or numb, or may be easily startled. In severe forms, PTSD can significantly impair a person's ability to function at work, at home, and socially.\n\n\nAdditional information about PTSD can be found on the \nNIMH Health Topics page on Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd \n\n.\n\n\n"},

The NCS-A was a nationally representative, face-to-face survey of 10,123 adolescents aged 13 to 18 years in the continental United States. The survey was based on a dual-frame design that included 904 adolescent residents of the households that participated in the adult U.S. National Comorbidity Survey Replication and 9,244 adolescent students selected from a nationally representative sample of 320 schools. The survey was fielded between February 2001 and January 2004. DSM-IV mental disorders were assessed using a modified version of the fully structured World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview.\n\n\nSurvey Non-response:\n\n\n\nThe overall adolescent non-response rate was 24.4%. This is made up of non-response rates of 14.1% in the household sample, 18.2% in the un-blinded school sample, and 77.7% in the blinded school sample. Non-response was largely due to refusal (21.3%), which in the household and un-blinded school samples came largely from parents rather than adolescents (72.3% and 81.0%, respectively). The refusals in the blinded school sample, in comparison, came almost entirely (98.1%) from parents failing to return the signed consent postcard.\n\n  \nFor more information, see \nPMID: 19507169: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19507169 \n \n.\n\n\n\n"},

A few specific caveats are noted below.\nDiagnostic Assessment:\nFor the NSDUH survey — no exclusions were made for major depressive episode symptoms caused by medical illness, substance use disorders, or medication.\nFor the NSDUH survey, methodology developed prior to the 2013 publication of the current DSM-5 was used to facilitate year-to-year comparisons.\nThe adult and adolescent questions were adapted from the depression module in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R). Revisions to the questions in the modules were made primarily to reduce their length and to modify the NCS-R questions, which are interviewer-administered, to the audio computer-assisted self-interviewing (ACASI) format used in NSDUH. In addition, some revisions, based on cognitive testing, were made to improve comprehension. Furthermore, even though titles similar to those used in the NCS-R were used for the NSDUH modules, the results of these items may not be directly comparable. This is mainly due to differing modes of administration in each survey (ACASI in NSDUH vs. computer-assisted personal interviewing in NCS-R), revisions to wording necessary to maintain the logical processes of the ACASI environment, and possible context effects resulting from deleting questions not explicitly pertinent to major depression.\nSome questions in the adult depression module differ slightly from questions in the adolescent depression module; as such, major depressive episode data for adults aged 18 or older should not be compared to or combined with major depressive episode data for youths aged 12 to 17.\nThe Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) was used to assess the impact of major depressive episode on a person’s life. The SDS is a brief self-report tool with ratings from 0 to 10 (with 10 being the highest) for the level of impairment caused by the disorder in each of four role domains: home management, work, close relationships with others, and social life. A rating of ≥7 in at least one domain is considered to be severe impairment. Respondents were excluded if SDS role impairment severity was unknown, or if particular activities listed in the SDS were not applicable. For SDS level of impairment, the role domains for adolescents aged 12 to 17 were slightly modified from those for adults to be made age appropriate.\nPopulation:\nThe entirety of NSDUH respondents for the major depressive episode estimates is the civilian, non-institutionalized population aged 12-17 (adolescents) and 18 years old or older (adults) residing within the United States.\nThe survey covers residents of households (persons living in houses/townhouses, apartments, condominiums; civilians living in housing on military bases, etc.) and persons in non-institutional group quarters (e.g., shelters, rooming/boarding houses, college dormitories, migratory workers' camps, and halfway houses).\nThe survey does not cover persons who, for the entire year, had no fixed address (e.g., homeless and/or transient persons not in shelters); were on active military duty; or who resided in institutional group quarters (e.g., correctional facilities, nursing homes, mental institutions, long-term hospitals).\nData regarding sex of the respondent was assessed using male and female categories only. Gender identity information was not collected in the survey.\nInterview Response and Completion:\nIn 2021, 54.1% of the selected NSDUH sample (participants ages 12+) did not complete the interview.\nReasons for non-response to interviewing include: refusal to participate (27.6%); respondent unavailable or no one at home (23.6%); and other reasons such as physical/mental incompetence or language barriers (2.9%).\nAdults and adolescents with major depressive episode may disproportionately fall into these non-response categories. While NSDUH weighting includes non-response adjustments to reduce bias, these adjustments may not fully account for differential non-response by mental illness status.\nData Suppression:\nFor some groups, data are not reported due to low precision. Data may be suppressed in the above charts if the data do not meet acceptable ranges for prevalence estimates, standard error estimates, and sample size.\nBackground on the 2021 NSDUH and the COVID-19 Pandemic:\nDue to COVID-19, data collection methods for the 2021 NSDUH differed from previous years.\nThe 2021 NSDUH used multimode (both in-person and virtual) data collection procedures that were first implemented in the fourth quarter of the 2020 NSDUH.\nOverall, 54.6% of interviews were completed via the web, and 45.4% were completed in person.\n2021 NSDUH estimates are not comparable with estimates from prior years given the use of multimode data collection procedures throughout the entire year and the rate of non-response, per SAMHSA \nmethodological investigations: https://www.samhsa.gov/data/release/2021-national-survey-drug-use-and-health-nsduh-releases \n \n.\nEstimates based on web interviews are different from estimates based on in-person interviews.\nThe demographics (e.g., gender, race, education) of people responding to web interviews differed from people answering in-person.\nIn-person respondents were also more likely to report use of certain substances and were more likely to report experiencing mental health issues.\nLast Updated: July 2023\n\n"},

Unlike bulimia nervosa, binge eating episodes are not followed by purging, excessive exercise or fasting. As a result, people with binge eating disorder often are overweight or obese.\n\n\nBulimia Nervosa\n\n\nBulimia nervosa\n is characterized by binge eating (eating large amounts of food in a short time, along with the sense of a loss of control) followed by a type of behavior that compensates for the binge, such as purging (e.g., vomiting, excessive use of laxatives, or diuretics), fasting, and/or excessive exercise. Unlike anorexia nervosa, people with bulimia can fall within the normal range for their weight. But like people with anorexia, they often fear gaining weight, want desperately to lose weight, and are intensely unhappy with their body size and shape.\n\n\nAnorexia Nervosa\n\n\nAnorexia nervosa\n is characterized by a significant and persistent reduction in food intake leading to extremely low body weight in the context of age, sex, and physical health; a relentless pursuit of thinness; a distortion of body image and intense fear of gaining weight; and extremely disturbed eating behavior.

The DSM-IV criteria were used here. Participants for the main interview totaled 9,282 English-speaking, non-institutionalized, civilian respondents.

The NSCH was led by the National Center for Health Statistics at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention under the direction and sponsorship of the Maternal and Child Health Bureau, Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). The survey provides parent-reported data for children/adolescents with ADHD aged 4 to 17 years. Between February 2011 and June 2012, 95,677 interviews were completed. Landline and cell-phone interview completion rates were 54.1% and 41.2% respectively, with a 23.0% overall response rate.\n\n  \nFor more information, see \nPMID: 24342384: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Visser%5BAuthor%5D)%20AND%20parent-report%5BTitle%5D \n: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24342384/ \n \n and \nCDC’s NSCH FAQ page: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/slaits/nsch.htm \n \n.\n\n\nNational Comorbidity Survey Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A)\n\n\n\nDiagnostic Assessment and Population:\n\n\n\nThe NCS-A was carried out under a cooperative agreement sponsored by NIMH to meet a request from Congress to provide national data on the prevalence and correlates of mental disorders among U.S. youth. The NCS-A was a nationally representative, face-to-face survey of 10,123 adolescents aged 13 to 18 years in the continental United States. ADHD was assessed in a subsample of 8,470 adolescents. The survey was based on a dual-frame design that included 904 adolescent residents of the households that participated in the adult U.S. National Comorbidity Survey Replication and 9,244 adolescent students selected from a nationally representative sample of 320 schools. The survey was fielded between February 2001 and January 2004. DSM-IV mental disorders were assessed using a modified version of the fully structured World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview.\n\n\nSurvey Non-response:\n\n\n\nThe overall adolescent non-response rate was 24.4%. This is made up of non-response rates of 14.1% in the household sample, 18.2% in the un-blinded school sample, and 77.7% in the blinded school sample. Non-response was largely due to refusal (21.3%), which in the household and un-blinded school samples came largely from parents rather than adolescents (72.3% and 81.0%, respectively). The refusals in the blinded school sample, in comparison, came almost entirely (98.1%) from parents failing to return the signed consent postcard.\n\n  \nFor more information, see \nPMID: 19507169: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19507169 \n \n.\n\n\nNational Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R)\n\n\n\nDiagnostic Assessment and Population:\n\n\n\nThe NCS-R is a nationally representative, face-to-face, household survey conducted between February 2001 and April 2003 with a response rate of 70.9%. DSM-IV mental disorders were assessed using a modified version of the fully structured World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WMH-CIDI), a fully structured lay-administered diagnostic interview that generates both International Classification of Diseases, 10\nth\n Revision, and DSM-IV diagnoses.

However, there are known patterns of high comorbidities among mental disorders; these patterns increase the likelihood that people who meet AMI and/or SMI criteria were detected by the study, as they may also have one or more of the disorders assessed in the SCID-I/NP.\n\n\nPopulation:\n\n\n\nThe entirety of NSDUH respondents for the AMI and SMI estimates were the civilian, non-institutionalized population aged 18 years old or older residing within the United States.\n\n\t\nThe survey covered residents of households (persons living in houses/townhouses, apartments, condominiums; civilians living in housing on military bases, etc.) and persons in non-institutional group quarters (e.g., shelters, rooming/boarding houses, college dormitories, migratory workers' camps, and halfway houses).\n\n\t\nThe survey did not cover persons who, for the entire year, had no fixed address (e.g., homeless and/or transient persons not in shelters); were on active military duty; or who resided in institutional group quarters (e.g., correctional facilities, nursing homes, mental institutions, long-term hospitals).\n\n\t\nSome people in these excluded categories had AMI and/or SMI, but were not accounted for in the NSDUH AMI and/or SMI estimates.\n\n\t\nData regarding sex of the respondent was assessed using male and female categories only. Gender identity information was not collected in the survey.\n\n\nSurvey Non-response:\n\n\n\nIn 2021, 53.0% of the selected NSDUH sample of people 18 or older did not complete the interview. This rate of non-response is higher than in previous years. Please see the Background on the 2021 NSDUH and the COVID-19 Pandemic section below for more information. \n\n\t\nReasons for non-response to interviewing include the following: refusal to participate (30.1%); respondent unavailable or never at home (18.8%); and other reasons such as physical/mental incompetence or language barriers (4.2%).\n\n\t\nPeople with mental illness may disproportionately fall into these non-response categories. While NSDUH weighting includes non-response adjustments to reduce bias, these adjustments may not fully account for differential non-response by mental illness status.\n\n\nData Suppression:\n\n\n\nFor some groups, data are not reported due to low precision. Data may be suppressed in the above charts if the data do not meet acceptable ranges for prevalence estimates, standard error estimates, and sample size.\n\n\nBackground on the 2021 NSDUH and the COVID-19 Pandemic:\n\n\n\nData collection methods for the 2021 NSDUH changed in several ways because of the COVID-19 pandemic: the 2021 NSDUH continued the use of multimode data collection procedures (both in-person and virtual data collection) that were first implemented in the fourth quarter of the 2020 NSDUH. Overall, 54.6% of interviews were completed via the web, and 45.4% were completed in person. In 2021, the weighted response rates for household screening and for interviewing were 22.2% and 46.2%, respectively, for an overall response rate of 10.3% for people aged 12 or older.\n\n\t\nGiven the use of multimode data collection procedures throughout the entirety of the collection year and the rate of non-response, comparison of estimates from the 2021 NSDUH with those from prior years must be made with caution.\n\n\nPlease see the \n2021 National Survey on Drug Use and Health Methodological Summary and Definitions report : https://www.samhsa.gov/data/report/2021-methodological-summary-and-definitions \n \nfor further information on how these data were collected and calculated.\n\n\n\nNational Comorbidity Survey Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A)\n\n\n\nDiagnostic Assessment and Population:\n\n\n\nThe NCS-A was carried out under a cooperative agreement sponsored by NIMH to meet a request from Congress to provide national data on the prevalence and correlates of mental disorders among U.S. youth. The NCS-A was a nationally representative, face-to-face survey of 10,123 adolescents aged 13 to 18 years in the continental United States. The survey was based on a dual-frame design that included 904 adolescent residents of the households that participated in the adult U.S. National Comorbidity Survey Replication and 9,244 adolescent students selected from a nationally representative sample of 320 schools. The survey was fielded between February 2001 and January 2004. DSM-IV mental disorders were assessed using a modified version of the fully structured World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview.\n\n\nSurvey Non-response:\n\n\n\nThe overall adolescent non-response rate was 24.4%. This is made up of non-response rates of 14.1% in the household sample, 18.2% in the un-blinded school sample, and 77.7% in the blinded school sample. Non-response was largely due to refusal (21.3%), which in the household and un-blinded school samples came largely from parents rather than adolescents (72.3% and 81.0%, respectively). The refusals in the blinded school sample, in comparison, came almost entirely (98.1%) from parents failing to return the signed consent postcard.\n\n\nFor more information, see \nPMID: 19507169: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19507169 \n \n and the \nNIMH NCS-A study page: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/archive/news/2010/national-survey-confirms-that-youth-are-disproportionately-affected-by-mental-disorders \n\n.\n\n\n\nLast Updated: March 2023\n\n\n"},

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use during pregnancy is both safe and effective in preventing HIV. However, posttraumatic stress (associated with intimate partner violence and/or other traumas) and depression negatively impact PrEP adherence among women in SA. Addressing posttraumatic stress and depression will likely improve PrEP adherence and persistence (i.e., sustained PrEP adherence over time) during pregnancy and breastfeeding, which are periods of dramatically increased HIV risk. The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop and test the feasibility and acceptability of a cognitive behavioral intervention that targets common underlying factors of posttraumatic stress and depression to improve PrEP adherence and persistence during pregnancy and the postpartum transition. The specific aims of the project are to (1) explore the mechanisms by which posttraumatic stress and depression impact PrEP adherence and persistence during pregnancy via qualitative interviews; (2) develop a brief PrEP adherence and persistence intervention (~4 sessions) that reduces the negative impact of psychological mechanisms common to posttraumatic stress and depression on PrEP use, and builds behavioral skills to improve self-care; and (3) evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and signals of preliminary efficacy of the intervention, which will be integrated into antenatal care, in a pilot randomized controlled trial.

While there has been much speculation about possible biologically based etiologies for postpartum disorders (PPD), none has ever been confirmed. Preliminary results from two related studies (protocols 90-M-0088, 92-M-0174) provide evidence that women with menstrual cycle related mood disorder, but not controls, experience mood disturbances during exogenous replacement of physiologic levels of gonadal steroids. The present protocol is designed to create a \"scaled-down\" hormonal milieu of pregnancy and the puerperium in order to determine whether women who have had a previous episode of postpartum major effective episode will experience differential mood and behavioral effects compared with controls and to determine whether it is the abrupt withdrawal of gonadal steroids or the prolonged exposure to gonadal steroids that is associated with mood symptoms. Supraphysiologic plasma levels of gonadal steroids will be established, maintained, and then rapidly reduced, simulating the hormonal events that occur during pregnancy and parturition. This will be accomplished by administering estradiol and progesterone to women who are pretreated with a gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist (Lupron). After eight weeks, administration of gonadal steroids will be stopped in one group of patients and controls, and a sudden decline in the plasma hormone levels will be precipitated. Another group will be maintained on supraphysiologic levels of estrogen and progesterone for an additional month. Outcome measures will include mood, behavioral and hormonal parameters (a separate protocol done in collaboration with NICHD)."},

The findings from this study will provide the necessary groundwork to examine the efficacy of this combined HIV-IPV intervention in a future, large-scale clinical trial.\nThere are several components to this research study:\nFirst, participants will be asked to complete a series of screening interviews/questionnaires to determine eligibility, including completing a HIV test. If eligible, participants will then take part in a 2-3 hour baseline assessment consisting of both interviewer administered questionnaires as well as self-administered surveys.

Both interventions offer unique components and the researchers do not yet know the impact the programs may have on participants' overall well-being. Participants randomized to Project STARS, will be invited to complete a semi-structured exit interview (lasting 60-90 min.) after the completion of the program.

Increased brain activity after making mistakes, as reflected by the error-related negativity (ERN), is observed in people with anxiety disorders, even before disorder onset. The ERN is therefore of great interest as a potentially modifiable risk factor for anxiety. However, methodological issues can make the ERN difficult to measure.\nIncreased brain activity in response to a balance disturbance, as reflected by the balance N1, resembles the ERN, but does not share its methodological issues. The investigators' preliminary data demonstrate that the balance N1 and the ERN are associated in amplitude in adults, suggesting they may depend on the same brain processes. The balance N1 has never been investigated in individuals with anxiety disorders, but it increases in amplitude within individuals under anxiety-inducing environmental contexts. Further, balance and anxiety are related in terms of brain anatomy, daily behavior, disorder presentation, and response to treatment.\nThe present investigation will measure the ERN and the balance N1 in children (ages 9-12) with anxiety disorders, and further, how these brain activity measures change in response to a brief, 45-minute, computerized psychosocial intervention that was developed to reduce reactivity to errors, and has been shown to reduce the ERN. The investigators will recruit approximately 80 children with anxiety disorders, half of whom will be randomly assigned to the active intervention condition. The other half will be assigned to an active control condition, consisting of a different 45-minute computerized presentation. Participants assigned to the control condition can access the computerized intervention after participation in the study.\nThe purpose of this investigation is to test the hypothesis that the balance N1 and the ERN will be reduced to a similar extent after the intervention, to demonstrate that these brain responses arise from shared brain processes. Transfer of the effect of the psycho-social intervention to the balance N1 would provide insight into prior work demonstrating that balance training can alleviate anxiety in young children, and well-documented benefits of psychotherapy to balance disorders. Collectively, these data may guide the development of multidisciplinary interventions for the prevention and treatment of anxiety disorders in children.\n\r\n\n\n                              "},

The specific aims of the project are to (1) explore the mechanisms by which posttraumatic stress and depression impact PrEP adherence and persistence during pregnancy via qualitative interviews; (2) develop a brief PrEP adherence and persistence intervention (~4 sessions) that reduces the negative impact of psychological mechanisms common to posttraumatic stress and depression on PrEP use, and builds behavioral skills to improve self-care; and (3) evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and signals of preliminary efficacy of the intervention, which will be integrated into antenatal care, in a pilot randomized controlled trial. All data will be collected in the Midwife Obstetrics Unit (MOU) in Gugulethu, a peri-urban settlement and former township community outside of Cape Town, SA."},

PTSD-BPD is associated with even greater functional impairment and higher healthcare burden than either disorder alone. There are surprisingly few treatments available for this clinical profile, despite its association with major negative health outcomes, cost, and morbidity. There is a pressing need to innovate treatments that can effectively and efficiently treat PTSD-BPD. The existing treatments used for PTSD-BPD are lengthy, laborious, resource-intensive, and require complete cessation of suicidal behaviors prior to treatment. Furthermore, no integrated treatment has been innovated to deliver the active ingredients to efficiently affect the mechanisms underpinning this comorbidity. The investigators propose to examine an adapted version of a first-line PTSD intervention, Cognitive Processing Therapy, augmented with a Suicide Risk Management, i.e., (CPT+SRM) as a brief (12 sessions) and more parsimonious treatment alternative that strategically targets shared mechanisms underpinning PTSD and BPD. The purpose of this pilot study is to 1) collect initial feasibility, acceptability, and safety data on this adapted treatment, 2) conduct a pilot randomized clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of CPT+SRM versus Treatment as Usual (TAU) + SRM, and 3) evaluate two targets (i.e, improvements in emotional intensity and cognitive dysfunction) as mechanisms leading to change in our primary outcomes. Both treatment conditions will be administered via telehealth.\nPotential benefits include reduction in participants' PTSD, BPD and other mental health symptoms. Additionally, this work could benefit the community by improving the treatment repertoire for PTSD-BPD. Potential risks include emotional distress, suicidality, and/or self-harm.

Neurobiological factors impacted by life experiences, stress, and genetics can affect treatment responses. These factors can alter brain capacities needed to reprocess traumatic memories prevent them from triggering intensely distressing, disruptive, out-of-place responses.\nFor example, during psychotherapy for PTSD, trauma memory activation engages two competing brain processes that affect recovery: \"extinction\" versus \"reconsolidation\" of trauma-related emotional, physiological, and behavioral responses. This study tests whether a single intravenous (IV) dose of allopregnanolone (Allo) compared to placebo (which is non-active):\npromotes consolidation of extinction learning (sub-study 1) or blocks reconsolidation physiological responses triggered by aversive memories (sub-study 2).\nThe study also tests whether Allo compared to placebo affects retention of non-aversive memories."},

One example of the need to improve dissemination and implementation of psychosocial treatments is for adolescent Anorexia Nervosa (AN), a serious mental disorder with an incidence rate of about 1% that can become life-threatening. Based on outcomes from a series of randomized clinical trials (RCTs), the first-line treatment for adolescent AN is Family-based Treatment (FBT); however, very few therapists are trained to use FBT for AN. Further, while approximately 45-50% of US mental health outpatient providers are in private practice, little attention has been paid to how best to train this group. Care for adolescent AN, in particular, is provided in private practice at high rates, because specialist programs in non-private settings are few and not readily accessible. Motivations, incentives, and rationale for learning evidence-based treatments (EBTs) differ in this group compared to therapists embedded in an organization or health care system. In this application, we propose to use an online training strategy to study the adoption of FBT to better understand factors that limit or enhance uptake and implementation of this treatment in private practice. We developed and piloted a self-directed enhanced online training (ET-FBT) aimed at improving therapist skills and knowledge related to key components of FBT for AN that predict patient outcome in a group of therapists of which 64% were in private practice. We propose to build on these findings to examine the feasibility of new methods to retain therapists during supervision, assess fidelity, and collect patient outcomes from clinicians in private practice. Thus, our specific aims are:\nAim 1: The overall aim of the study is to assess the feasibility of conducting a randomized clinical trial comparing two implementation strategies (online training vs webinar training) for training clinicians in private practice in FBT for AN. We predict that those randomized to online training will be retained, receive supervision, and provide patient data at higher rates than those who receive webinar training.\nAim 2: Patient outcomes (reflecting therapist effectiveness) will be assessed by comparing patient weight gain from session 1 to 4 of FBT before and after training (target for training effect) and compared between randomized groups. We predict a moderate efficacy signal difference favoring those who are received the online training. because of increased training in key components in the online training program.\nAim 3: Validate training effect by examining the association between therapist fidelity to FBT and patient outcomes. We predict that fidelity will be correlated (target validation) with patient outcome. The effects of therapeutic alliance, participation in supervision, and self-efficacy on both fidelity and patient outcome will be explored.\nAim 4: Explore BL factors associated with implementation processes (e.g. prior training, experience, family work).The primary significance of this study is its potential to increase the availability of FBT--the most effective treatment for adolescent AN. Increased availability of FBT will decrease cost, hospitalization, morbidity, mortality, and chronicity of the disorder."},

Studies show that some students respond rapidly to treatment, whereas others require considerably more resources. Evidence-based adaptive treatment strategies (ATSs) are needed to address this heterogeneity in responsivity and complexity. ATSs individualize treatment via decision rules specifying how the type and intensity of an intervention can be sequenced based on risk factors, response, or compliance.\nThe purpose of this multisite study is to investigate the effectiveness of four adaptive treatment strategies (ATSs) to treat college students who report suicidal ideation when first seeking services at their college counseling center\nThis multisite study will enroll moderately to severely suicidal college students in the \"emerging adulthood\" phase (ages 18-25) seeking services at CCCs. This Sequential Multi-Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) will have two stages of intervention. In Stage 1, 700 participants from four CCCs will be randomized to 4-8 weeks of: 1) a suicide-focused treatment - Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality (CAMS) or 2) Treatment as Usual (TAU). Sufficient responders to either intervention will discontinue services/be stepped down.

PTSD-BPD is associated with even greater functional impairment and higher healthcare burden than either disorder alone. There are surprisingly few treatments available for this clinical profile, despite its association with major negative health outcomes, cost, and morbidity. There is a pressing need to innovate treatments that can effectively and efficiently treat PTSD-BPD. The existing treatments used for PTSD-BPD are lengthy, laborious, resource-intensive, and require complete cessation of suicidal behaviors prior to treatment. Furthermore, no integrated treatment has been innovated to deliver the active ingredients to efficiently affect the mechanisms underpinning this comorbidity. The investigators propose to examine an adapted version of a first-line PTSD intervention, Cognitive Processing Therapy, augmented with a Suicide Risk Management, i.e., (CPT+SRM) as a brief (12 sessions) and more parsimonious treatment alternative that strategically targets shared mechanisms underpinning PTSD and BPD. The purpose of this pilot study is to 1) collect initial feasibility, acceptability, and safety data on this adapted treatment, 2) conduct a pilot randomized clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of CPT+SRM versus Treatment as Usual (TAU) + SRM, and 3) evaluate two targets (i.e, improvements in emotional intensity and cognitive dysfunction) as mechanisms leading to change in our primary outcomes. Both treatment conditions will be administered via telehealth.\nPotential benefits include reduction in participants' PTSD, BPD and other mental health symptoms. Additionally, this work could benefit the community by improving the treatment repertoire for PTSD-BPD. Potential risks include emotional distress, suicidality, and/or self-harm. Participants may experience discomfort and/or distress while discussing participants trauma(s) and mental health. These risks will be mitigated using a suicide risk management protocol which therapists in the assessment of risk and protective factors of suicide, followed by documentation for the decision-making around the management of risk."},

There is no gold standard for evaluating suicidal thoughts and behaviors in young people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or other neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). Also, youth with ASD/NDD are often excluded from many research studies. Because of this, researchers need more data. They want to make sure they are asking the best questions for young people in clinics such as the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) clinic. They want to make sure they have the best data to determine if a person is at risk for hurting or killing himself or herself.\nObjective:\nTo develop and assess the efficacy of a suicide screening tool for people with ASD/NDD.\nEligibility:\nYouth ages 8 to 17 who are engaged in assessment or treatment at the NIMH for ASD or other NDD\nDesign:\nParticipants will fill out 4 questionnaires during a 1-hour meeting with study staff. They will answer questions about how they have been feeling. They will be asked if they think about or plan to hurt or kill themselves. They will also be asked if they have ever thought about it or planned it in the past. Other questions will assess their understanding of death. Participants can take a break if needed.\nParents of the participants will be asked similar questions.\nParents will be informed if their child has current thoughts of suicide.\nAbout 1 week after the initial assessment, parents will be contacted to fill out a follow-up questionnaire.

This responsiveness is reflected in their expression in individuals who are affected by environment such as stress. The investigators are gathering genetic material, including DNA and RNA, from each participant. The RNA will be taken from the small vesicles and cells in the participant's blood and analyzed. The vesicles are small objects that occur normally in the blood and that contain RNA.

This is especially true for children from traditionally underserved groups and communities. Without innovative approaches for enhanced identification of ASD, families and clinicians will continue to struggle with accessing and providing care. Telemedicine offers tremendous potential for addressing this need, but there are few psychometrically sound, validated tools that can be administered remotely, via telehealth platforms. This team of investigators developed and conducted a preliminary evaluation of a novel parent-administered, clinician-guided tele-diagnostic tool, the TAP (TELE-ASD-PEDS), designed specifically for direct-to-home and community clinic use with toddlers. Remote administration of the TAP yielded a very high level of agreement with blinded comprehensive evaluation regarding ASD risk classification. Subsequently, the unanticipated broad dissemination of the TAP during COVID-19 demonstrated its value for traditionally underserved groups, spanning broad geographies. Although promising, this work was limited by its specific focus on toddlers with ASD concerns. A telemedicine tool designed for the unique context and population of preschool-aged children referred for diagnostic assessment could have tremendous value in terms of both accurate identification as well as family engagement with service. In the current work, the investigators will now evaluate the performance, usability, and utility of the TAP-Preschool, a new telemedicine tool for ASD risk assessment in preschoolers, through a clinical trial. The TAP-Preschool was developed through a computationally informed co-production in which the targeted population were recruited as active partners in designing the tool. The investigators will gather critical data not only regarding its structure and accuracy, but also its potential deployment across systems responsible for engaging children and families from underserved groups in meaningful service. This work has potential to transform the ASD evaluation process and dramatically improve care access for traditionally underserved groups."},

By comparing test results and genetic samples from healthy volunteers, people with ASD, and parents (or caregivers or legal guardians) of the first two groups, researchers hope to better understand the neuroscience of ASD.\nObjectives:\nTo learn more about the brain in healthy people and in people with autism spectrum disorders. To study genes that might be involved in autism spectrum disorders by collecting DNA samples from participants.\nEligibility:\nThe following groups of participants will be eligible for the study:\nIndividuals between 5 and 89 years of age who have autism spectrum disorders. Healthy volunteers between 5 and 89 years of age. Cognitively impaired children between 5 and 17 years of age. Parents/caregivers/legal guardians of individuals in the above three groups.\nDesign:\nParticipants will visit the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center for research tests, which will be administered over multiple visits. Researchers will determine the specific tests to be administered based on the medical history of the study participant. Researchers will study the brain through interviews, tests of thinking and memory (neuropsychological tests), brain imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and magnetoencephalography (MEG). The study will also collect blood or saliva to obtain a DNA sample."},

These risks appear to be related solely to age of entry when other explanatory variables are controlled. This situation, termed the \"Relative Age Effect\"has potentially serious consequences for kindergarten children (e.g., greater likelihood of being prescribed psychoactive medication to control behavior).\nThe present proposal aims to develop a teacher intervention to attenuate the impact of the relative age effect on young kindergarteners with elevated ADHD symptoms, and test the correspondence between the hypothesized mechanisms and treatment outcomes related to ADHD (e.g., symptoms, impairment). Following intervention development and refinement, 60 children entering kindergarten in the fall, and young for the grade, will be randomly assigned to (1) Kindergarten as Usual (KAU); (2) a Relative Age Effect prevention intervention administered immediately; or (3) a Relative Age Effect prevention intervention administered mid-year. In the intervention groups, teachers will be introduced to the relative age effect, receive information on how to anchor behavioral ratings in developmental norms, and implement a positive behavioral support to support growth in the child across the kindergarten school year.\nPrimary aims will be to demonstrate the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention approach as well as the ability of the team to retain young children in a longitudinal trial. Further, the hypothesized mechanisms (e.g., improved neurocognitive functioning; improved teacher use of positive behavioral supports) will be measured and correspondence to hypothesized outcomes (e.g., reduced ADHD symptoms and impairment) will be evaluated. Anticipated benefits include attenuation of any negative effects for children who receive intervention, and risks include breach of confidentiality and worsening of symptoms initially if an intervention is instituted. The knowledge to be gained is important as it could reduce untoward outcomes for the relatively youngest children in the grade."},

An efficacious and feasible solution to improving affected youth's ADHD/ODD is training existing school clinicians to deliver evidence-based intervention with fidelity. Despite initial promising results of training school clinicians to treat ADHD/ODD in settings suffering from high unmet need, such as Mexico, scalability is limited by a lack of researchers with capacity to train, monitor, and evaluate school clinicians in such efforts on a large scale. Thus, there is a need to develop more feasible interventions and training programs for school clinicians, as well as create a system with capacity for scalable training and evaluation, to combat the widespread impact ofADHD/ODD worldwide. Converting interventions and school clinician professional development programs for fully-remote delivery allows for more flexibility, accessibility, affordability, scalability, and promise for ongoing consultation than in-person options. Supporting scalable training for school clinicians could address a significant public health concern in Mexico, as only 14% of Mexican youth with mental health disorders receive treatment and less than half of those treated receive more than minimally adequate care. The study team is uniquely suited for this effort, given that they developed the only known school-homeADHD/ODD evidence-based intervention in Latin America-and-have developed a web-based training for U.S. school clinicians with promising preliminary results. The study team's prior studies and high levels of unmet need make Mexico an ideal location for this proposal; however, lessons learned could be used to expand scalable school clinician training for evidence-based intervention in other settings and/or for other disorders. Thus, this study focuses on conducting an open-trial of the fully-remote program and make iterative changes. It is predicted that: H1) school clinicians trained remotely will be satisfied and show improved evidence-based practice skills; H2)families and teachers participating remotely will be satisfied and youth will show improved ADHD/ODD; H3) observation/feedback from a 3-school open-trial will guide iterative changes to the remote program."},

For example, susceptibility to distraction is associated with worse school and social performance, lower high school graduation rates, and increased incidence of serious accidents. The investigators' goal is to improve understanding of distractibility and develop a targeted treatment. The proposed intervention is based on models of habituation, which is a term that means reduced physiological and emotional response to a stimulus (e.g. moving object, or loud noise, etc.) as it is seen repeatedly. The investigators use virtual reality technology to show study participants distracting stimuli repeatedly in a virtual classroom setting, and their hypothesis states that participants will improve attention in the face of distraction by training with this technology intervention. The virtual classroom setting is especially relevant for children who have significant challenges with distractibility, such as children with ADHD. This intervention will likely be effective in helping individuals with other clinical disorders and perhaps the general population as well."},

These treatment recommendations can be implemented in the context of large healthcare delivery systems to improve the delivery of digital mental health interventions at scale.\nThe overarching aim of the current study is to better understand for whom and how leading digital interventions work in a large healthcare setting. The study builds on the existing literature and follows expert recommendations by using machine learning (ML) methods to develop precision treatment rules (PTRs) for three leading digital interventions for emotional disorders (e.g., anxiety, depression, and related mental health disorders). Specifically, ML methods will be used to develop PTRs to optimize clinical outcomes and associated intervention engagement. This study will leverage a unique partnership between Boston University (BU), SilverCloud Health (SC)--a leading provider of digital mental health care--and Kaiser Permanente (KP)--one of America's leading health care providers.\nA clinical trial (RCT) will be conducted to evaluate the relative effectiveness of three distinct empirically supported digital mental health interventions (from SC's existing library of programs) in a sample recruited from KP primary care and other clinical settings.

This study will implement a technology to assess and enhance the quality of EBPs like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) that includes a user interface geared to clinical, supervision, and administrative workflows and needs, and then assess this technology for effectiveness in comparison to usual care.\nThere is a tremendous global burden of mental illness: Over 50 million American adults have a diagnosable mental health disorder, and major depression on its own is the leading cause of disability worldwide. In the face of this burden, clinical research has documented a variety of effective EBPs (e.g. CBT), and these psychotherapies are utilized on a massive scale. Systems have invested over $2 billion in training providers in specific EBPs. Once trained, however, therapists' adherence to the EBP, also called fidelity, is both crucial for effectiveness and difficult to assess. There is no scalable method to assess the fidelity and quality of EBPs in community practice settings. This is a foundational problem for healthcare systems.\nAdvances in speech processing and machine learning make technology a promising solution to this problem. The use of technology - instead of humans - to evaluate EBPs means that objective, performance-based feedback can be provided quickly, efficiently, cost-effectively, and without human error. If successful, the present research will be among the first examples of a method for building, monitoring, and assessing the quality of therapy that can scale up to large, real-world healthcare settings.\nIn this study, the investigators will implement an existing, fully-functional prototype (LyssnCBT) that includes a user interface geared to community mental health (CMH) clinical, supervision, and administrative workflows and needs, and then assess for effectiveness of psychotherapy supported by LyssnCBT in comparison to usual care.\nThis study will implement LyssnCBT in 5 community mental health agencies, beginning with a single-arm pilot field trial to identify and address any specific barriers to implementing the tool in a community mental health context.

Increased brain activity after making mistakes, as reflected by the error-related negativity (ERN), is observed in people with anxiety disorders, even before disorder onset. The ERN is therefore of great interest as a potentially modifiable risk factor for anxiety. However, methodological issues can make the ERN difficult to measure.\nIncreased brain activity in response to a balance disturbance, as reflected by the balance N1, resembles the ERN, but does not share its methodological issues. The investigators' preliminary data demonstrate that the balance N1 and the ERN are associated in amplitude in adults, suggesting they may depend on the same brain processes. The balance N1 has never been investigated in individuals with anxiety disorders, but it increases in amplitude within individuals under anxiety-inducing environmental contexts. Further, balance and anxiety are related in terms of brain anatomy, daily behavior, disorder presentation, and response to treatment.\nThe present investigation will measure the ERN and the balance N1 in children (ages 9-12) with anxiety disorders, and further, how these brain activity measures change in response to a brief, 45-minute, computerized psychosocial intervention that was developed to reduce reactivity to errors, and has been shown to reduce the ERN. The investigators will recruit approximately 80 children with anxiety disorders, half of whom will be randomly assigned to the active intervention condition. The other half will be assigned to an active control condition, consisting of a different 45-minute computerized presentation. Participants assigned to the control condition can access the computerized intervention after participation in the study.\nThe purpose of this investigation is to test the hypothesis that the balance N1 and the ERN will be reduced to a similar extent after the intervention, to demonstrate that these brain responses arise from shared brain processes. Transfer of the effect of the psycho-social intervention to the balance N1 would provide insight into prior work demonstrating that balance training can alleviate anxiety in young children, and well-documented benefits of psychotherapy to balance disorders.

OCD is a disabling illness that affects around 2% of the population and involves recurrent intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors (compulsions) that lead to distress and/or impaired functioning. Nabilone is a synthetic form of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, the primary psychoactive component of the cannabis plant). It acts on the brain's endocannabinoid system, which has been hypothesized to play a role in OCD symptoms. Nabilone is approved by the FDA for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. It is not FDA-approved for treating OCD.\nIn this study, 60 adults with OCD will receive a single dose of either nabilone or placebo. Participants will then complete a series of assessments including neuroimaging, psychophysiology (e.g., skin conductance recording), computerized behavioral tasks, and self-report measures. The information gained from this study could contribute to the development of new treatments for people with OCD and related disorders."},

Less than 50% of patients experiencing long-lasting improvements to current gold-standard treatments. Two gold-standard behavioral interventions include behavioral activation, focused on enhancing approach behavior towards meaningful activities, and exposure-based therapy, focused on decreasing avoidance and challenging negative expectations. While these interventions have divergent treatment targets, there is little knowledge to inform which strategies should be used in the frequent case of comorbid anxiety and depression. Approach-avoidance decision-making paradigms focus on assessing responses when faced with potential rewards and threats, tapping into processes important for both anxiety and depression as well as behavioral activation and exposure-based therapy.\nFor this study, investigators will recruit individuals reporting both anxiety and depression symptoms and randomize them to one of three different interventions: (1) behavioral activation, (2) exposure-based therapy, and a non-specific therapy approach (3) supportive therapy. Participants will complete clinical, self-report, behavioral, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) assessments before and after therapy. Investigators will use a computational approach to model factors that may influence one's behavior during approach-avoidance decision-making, including drives to avoid threat versus approach reward and confidence versus uncertainty in one's decisions.\nThis project will accomplish the following aims (1) Determine how changes in brain and behavior responses during approach-avoidance conflict relate to changes in mental health symptoms with the different therapy approaches, (2) Determine the degree to which baseline brain and behavior responses during approach-avoidance conflict predict response to the different therapy approaches, above and beyond the influence of demographics and baseline symptom severity. In addition, by including peripheral blood draws and measures of grace matter volume, the project will also accomplish the following aims: (1) Determine whether kynrenine metabolites measures peripherally may be beneficial as a biomarker of treatment response and (2) determine whether there is an association between change in kynurenine metabolites and changes in gray matter volume with treatment.\nResults will enhance understanding of how different psychotherapy approaches (behavioral activation, exposure-based therapy) may impact brain responses and decisions when faces with potential reward versus threat and approach versus avoidance drives. In addition, results will have important implications concerning the potential for a more personalized approach to psychotherapy, enhancing knowledge of which types of therapy strategies may be most beneficial for which individuals."},

Thus, there is a critical need and opportunity to identify neural markers of risk that distinguish anxious from healthy trajectories early in development that may serve as novel targets for intervention - especially if they are evident before symptoms have become impairing. One promising neural marker of anxiety is increased brain activity in response to mistakes, as reflected by the error-related negativity (ERN). Considering that the ERN is elevated before anxiety symptoms become impairing, it is critical to identify environmental factors that may shape the ERN early in life - so that those factors can be manipulated to reduce the ERN and potentially mitigate risk. In a sample of 295 six-year old children, the investigators found that both observational and self-report measures of harsh parenting style related to an increased ERN in offspring. A similar pattern of results was reported by another lab among 4 year-old children. Moreover, results suggested that the ERN mediated the relationship between harsh parenting and child anxiety disorders.\nBased on these data, the investigators propose to develop a novel psychosocial intervention to be administered to both parents and children, which aims to normalize the ERN in children (i.e., reduce over-reactivity to making errors). The proposed Mentored Career Development Award (K01) is designed to extend the investigator's previous work on the ERN, parenting, and risk for anxiety in young children to test the extent to which the ERN can be modulated. Specifically, the investigators will recruit 100 parent/child dyads, high in error sensitivity, and randomize 75 to an intervention condition and 25 to an active control condition. The investigators will measure the ERN in children pre and post intervention, as well as baseline anxiety symptoms. At a six-month follow-up, the investigators will assess children's ERN, as well as anxiety symptoms, to examine to what extent intervention-related changes in the ERN relate to decreases in anxiety symptoms. Moreover, this training plan builds on the investigator's expertise on the ERN and anxiety, and integrates expertise in the design and implementation of computerized interventions, as well as advanced statistical analyses related to intervention outcomes."},

One especially vulnerable group is patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), a genetic blood disorder that primarily affects people of African descent, many of whom live in disadvantaged circumstances and are cared for in under-resourced settings. SCD causes severe acute and chronic pain, end-organ damage, and early mortality. Patients transitioning from adolescence to adulthood (ages16-30) are at high risk for mental health disorders and suicide.\nUsing mobile technology, the investigators can provide high-quality, evidence-based behavioral mental health treatment that reaches patients in different settings. Digital cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective for treating depression and anxiety and can be brought to scale at low cost. Despite the promise of digital CBT, there are barriers to its widespread use, particularly in low-resource settings serving minorities. Qualitative data show that cultural factors-lack of relatability, representation, and perceived stigma regarding mental health treatment-limit engagement with digital CBT programs. Population-and setting-specific adaptations to interventions can lead to their successful implementation and wider use. The investigators will work with a digital CBT program to decrease stigma and make it more relatable and relevant to young adults with SCD, by devising changes to advertising and promotion, and tailoring communication with an integrated health coach, Aim 1: Use implementation science (ImS) and human-centered design methods to define the barriers to delivering routine mental health screening and digital CBT to adolescents and young adults with SCD. Aim 2: Rapidly iterate, test, and evaluate adaptations to the implementation strategy for a coach-enhanced digital mental health service. Aim 3: Demonstrate that a population-specific implementation strategy improves engagement with a digital CBT-based mental health service.\nThe investigators will capitalize on our mobile technology tools, interdisciplinary expertise, and community-based partnerships to investigate the implementation of digital CBT into low-resource clinics and community-based organizations serving adolescents and adults with sickle cell disease."},

The primary goal of the project is to document, in pediatric anxiety disorders and major depression, perturbations in brain systems mediating attention biases, fear conditioning, emotional memory, and response to various forms of motivational stimuli. As one secondary goal, the project measures the relationship between these factors and treatment response to either fluoxetine, a specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), or interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT). Another secondary goal examines similar associations in adults.\nStudy Population: A total of 2530 children, adolescents, and adults will be recruited. Most subjects will not be able to complete all procedures. We seek to comprehensively study 150 juveniles with only a current anxiety disorder, 60 juveniles with current major depression, 150 juveniles with no psychiatric disorder, 100 adults with major depression, 60 adults with an anxiety disorder, and 150 adults with no psychiatric disorder. To achieve this, we are recruiting 2530 individuals.\nDesign: Subjects will be tested using fMRI paradigms designed to examine brain regions engaged when processing motivationally salient stimuli, as assessed during attention, memory, social interaction, reward, and fear-conditioning paradigms. After these initial fMRI tests, subjects with depression or an anxiety disorder receive treatment. Treatment will comprise open treatment with either fluoxetine or CBT, augmented with computer-based attention retraining, delivered in a randomized-controlled design, with random assignment to either active or placebo attentiontraining regimens. Adolescent subjects then will be re-tested after eight-weeks using only the attention, memory, and conditioning paradigms.\nOutcome Measures: Prior imaging studies note that tasks requiring attention modulation, emotional memory, social interchange, and fear conditioning engage brain regions previously implicated in adult mood and anxiety disorders. These regions include most consistently the amygdala and ventral prefrontal cortex. Moreover, imaging studies of reward function implicate the striatum and prefrontal cortex in adult mood disorders. As a result, we hypothesize that attention, memory, social interaction, reward, and conditioning paradigms will engage the amygdala, ventral prefrontal cortex and striatum in both psychiatrically healthy and impaired subjects. Moreover, we hypothesize that these healthy and psychiatrically impaired groups will differ in the degree of engagement.\nJuvenile subjects also will be treated for eight-weeks, and a subset will be re-tested with fMRI. We predict that pre-treatment abnormalities in neural circuitry will predict response to treatment, such that increased amygdala and prefrontal activation will occur in individuals who show the strongest response to treatment. Moreover, we hypothesize that effective treatment will normalize abnormalities in attention and emotional memory, as manifest in fMRI."},

In addition the protocol will allow clinicians to gain more experience in the use of a variety of polysomnographic and high-density EEG recordings. Subjects in this protocol will undergo an evaluation which may include: a psychiatric interview; a diagnostic interview; rating scales; a medical history; a physical exam; brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); electroencephalography (EEG); electrocardiography (EKG), magnetoencephalography (MEG); blood, saliva and urine laboratory evaluation; and a request for medical records. Subjects may also be asked to complete questionnaires about attitudes towards research and motivation for research participation. The data collected may also be linked with data from other mood and anxiety disorder protocols (e.g., brain imaging, DNA, psychophysiology tests, treatment studies, etc) for the purposes of better understanding the diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment response of patients with mood disorders. Parents of minors will be interviewed. Upon conclusion of the screening process, subjects will either be offered participation in a research protocol and will sign the appropriate informed consent, or will be considered not appropriate for participation in research and will be referred back into the community. The current protocol thus serves as an entry point for individuals with mood or anxiety disorders or healthy volunteers to enter NIMH IRB approved ETPB protocols.\n\r\n\n\n                              "},

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use during pregnancy is both safe and effective in preventing HIV. However, posttraumatic stress (associated with intimate partner violence and/or other traumas) and depression negatively impact PrEP adherence among women in SA. Addressing posttraumatic stress and depression will likely improve PrEP adherence and persistence (i.e., sustained PrEP adherence over time) during pregnancy and breastfeeding, which are periods of dramatically increased HIV risk. The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop and test the feasibility and acceptability of a cognitive behavioral intervention that targets common underlying factors of posttraumatic stress and depression to improve PrEP adherence and persistence during pregnancy and the postpartum transition. The specific aims of the project are to (1) explore the mechanisms by which posttraumatic stress and depression impact PrEP adherence and persistence during pregnancy via qualitative interviews; (2) develop a brief PrEP adherence and persistence intervention (~4 sessions) that reduces the negative impact of psychological mechanisms common to posttraumatic stress and depression on PrEP use, and builds behavioral skills to improve self-care; and (3) evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and signals of preliminary efficacy of the intervention, which will be integrated into antenatal care, in a pilot randomized controlled trial.

This study will be conducted remotely, and participants can participate at home with their own electronic devices.\nThe aim of this study is to investigate a well-defined 12-week mobile intervention program specifically designed to target cognitive functioning and motivated behavior for individuals with early psychosis. Participants will complete a screening interview which will include diagnosis and symptom ratings, neurocognitive assessment, and self-reports of symptoms, behavior, and functioning. Then participants will be randomized to receive the 12-week mobile intervention, or an active control of treatment as usual. The investigators will test for differences in the clinical trajectories after training, and at two follow up appointments at 6 and 12 months post-training."},

In the proposed study, decision rules will develop for selecting the digital program that is most likely to be the optimal intervention for each user. These treatment recommendations can be implemented in the context of large healthcare delivery systems to improve the delivery of digital mental health interventions at scale.\nThe overarching aim of the current study is to better understand for whom and how leading digital interventions work in a large healthcare setting. The study builds on the existing literature and follows expert recommendations by using machine learning (ML) methods to develop precision treatment rules (PTRs) for three leading digital interventions for emotional disorders (e.g., anxiety, depression, and related mental health disorders). Specifically, ML methods will be used to develop PTRs to optimize clinical outcomes and associated intervention engagement. This study will leverage a unique partnership between Boston University (BU), SilverCloud Health (SC)--a leading provider of digital mental health care--and Kaiser Permanente (KP)--one of America's leading health care providers.\nA clinical trial (RCT) will be conducted to evaluate the relative effectiveness of three distinct empirically supported digital mental health interventions (from SC's existing library of programs) in a sample recruited from KP primary care and other clinical settings. Data from this trial will be used to develop theoretically and empirically informed, reliable selection algorithms for managing treatment delivery decisions. Algorithms will be validated in a separate \"holdout\" dataset by examining whether allocation to predicted optimal treatment is associated with superior outcomes compared to allocation to a non-optimal treatment.

This study will implement a technology to assess and enhance the quality of EBPs like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) that includes a user interface geared to clinical, supervision, and administrative workflows and needs, and then assess this technology for effectiveness in comparison to usual care.\nThere is a tremendous global burden of mental illness: Over 50 million American adults have a diagnosable mental health disorder, and major depression on its own is the leading cause of disability worldwide. In the face of this burden, clinical research has documented a variety of effective EBPs (e.g. CBT), and these psychotherapies are utilized on a massive scale. Systems have invested over $2 billion in training providers in specific EBPs. Once trained, however, therapists' adherence to the EBP, also called fidelity, is both crucial for effectiveness and difficult to assess. There is no scalable method to assess the fidelity and quality of EBPs in community practice settings. This is a foundational problem for healthcare systems.\nAdvances in speech processing and machine learning make technology a promising solution to this problem. The use of technology - instead of humans - to evaluate EBPs means that objective, performance-based feedback can be provided quickly, efficiently, cost-effectively, and without human error. If successful, the present research will be among the first examples of a method for building, monitoring, and assessing the quality of therapy that can scale up to large, real-world healthcare settings.\nIn this study, the investigators will implement an existing, fully-functional prototype (LyssnCBT) that includes a user interface geared to community mental health (CMH) clinical, supervision, and administrative workflows and needs, and then assess for effectiveness of psychotherapy supported by LyssnCBT in comparison to usual care.\nThis study will implement LyssnCBT in 5 community mental health agencies, beginning with a single-arm pilot field trial to identify and address any specific barriers to implementing the tool in a community mental health context. The study team will then conduct a larger study in community mental health agencies comparing LyssnCBT to services as usual."},

{"title": "Substance Use and Co-Occurring Mental Disorders", "heading": "Overview", "text": "\n  \nOverview\n\n  \n    \n\n\nSubstance use disorder (SUD) is a treatable mental disorder that affects a person’s brain and behavior, leading to their inability to control their use of substances like legal or illegal drugs, alcohol, or medications. Symptoms can be moderate to severe, with addiction being the most severe form of SUD.\n\n\n\nPeople with a SUD may also have other mental health disorders, and people with mental health disorders may also struggle with substance use. These other mental health disorders can include \nanxiety disorders: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/anxiety-disorders \n\n, \ndepression: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/depression \n\n, \nattention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd \n\n, \nbipolar disorder: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/bipolar-disorder \n\n, \npersonality disorders: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/borderline-personality-disorder \n\n, and \nschizophrenia: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/schizophrenia \n\n, among others.

Research suggests three possibilities that could explain why SUDs and other mental disorders may occur together:\n\n\n\nCommon risk factors can contribute to both SUDs and other mental disorders. \nBoth SUDs and other mental disorders can run in families, meaning certain genes may be a risk factor. Environmental factors, such as stress or trauma, can cause genetic changes that are passed down through generations and may contribute to the development of a mental disorder or a substance use disorder.\n\n\t\nMental disorders can contribute to substance use and SUDs.\n Studies found that people with a mental disorder, such as anxiety, depression: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/depression \n, or \npost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd \n\n, may use drugs or alcohol as a form of self-medication. However, although some drugs may temporarily help with some symptoms of mental disorders, they may make the symptoms worse over time. Additionally, brain changes in people with mental disorders may enhance the rewarding effects of substances, making it more likely they will continue to use the substance.\n\n\t\nSubstance use and SUDs can contribute to the development of other mental disorders.\n Substance use may trigger changes in brain structure and function that make a person more likely to develop a mental disorder.\n\n\n\n\n"},
{"title": "Substance Use and Co-Occurring Mental Disorders", "heading": "Diagnosis and treatment", "text": "\n  \nDiagnosis and treatment\n\n  \n    \nWhen someone has a SUD and another mental health disorder, it is usually better to treat them at the same time rather than separately. People who need help for a SUD and other mental disorders should see a health care provider for each disorder. It can be challenging to make an accurate diagnosis because some symptoms are the same for both disorders, so the provider should use comprehensive assessment tools to reduce the chance of a missed diagnosis and provide the right treatment.\n\n\n\nIt also is essential that the provider tailor treatment, which may include behavioral therapies and medications, to an individual’s specific combination of disorders and symptoms. It should also take into account the person’s age, the misused substance, and the specific mental disorder(s). Talk to your health care provider to determine what treatment may be best for you and give the treatment time to work.\n\n\n\nBehavioral therapies\n\n\n\nResearch has found several behavioral therapies that have promise for treating individuals with co-occurring substance use and mental disorders. Health care providers may recommend behavioral therapies alone or in combination with medications.\n\n\n\nSome examples of effective behavioral therapies for adults with SUDs and different co-occurring mental disorders include:\n\n\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)\n is a type of \ntalk therapy: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/psychotherapies \n\n aimed at helping people learn how to cope with difficult situations by challenging irrational thoughts and changing behaviors.\n\n\t\nDialectical behavior therapy (DBT)\n uses concepts of mindfulness and acceptance or being aware of and attentive to the current situation and emotional state. DBT also teaches skills that can help control intense emotions, reduce self-destructive behaviors (such as suicide attempts, thoughts, or urges; self-harm; and drug use), and improve relationships.\n\n\t\nAssertive community treatment (ACT)\n is a form of community-based mental health care that emphasizes outreach to the community and an individualized treatment approach.\n\n\t\nTherapeutic communities (TC)\n \n are a common form of long-term residential treatment that focuses on helping people develop new and healthier values, attitudes, and behaviors.\n\n\t\nContingency management (CM)\n principles encourage healthy behaviors by offering vouchers or rewards for desired behaviors.\n\n\nBehavioral therapies for children and adolescents\n\n\n\nSome effective behavioral treatments for children and adolescents include:\n\n\n\nBrief strategic family therapy (BSFT)\n therapy targets family interactions thought to maintain or worsen adolescent SUDs and other co-occurring problem behaviors.\n\n\t\nMultidimensional family therapy (MDFT)\n works with the whole family to simultaneously address multiple and interacting adolescent problem behaviors, such as substance use, mental disorders, school problems, delinquency, and others.\n\n\t\nMultisystemic therapy (MST)\n targets key factors associated with serious antisocial behavior in children and adolescents with SUDs.\n\n\nMedications\n\n\n\nThere are effective medications that treat \nopioid: https://nida.nih.gov/publications/research-reports/medications-to-treat-opioid-addiction/overview \n \n, \nalcohol: https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/brochures-and-fact-sheets/treatment-alcohol-problems-finding-and-getting-help#pub-toc3 \n \n, and \nnicotine addiction: https://smokefree.gov/tools-tips/how-to-quit/medications-can-help-you-quit \n \n and lessen the symptoms of many other mental disorders.

One promising candidate treatment is transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a low-cost technique that involves placing electrodes on specific scalp locations and using a 9-volt battery to cause a small amount of electricity to pass through parts of the brain. Depending on the direction of electrical flow, tDCS can make brain cells (neurons) more likely or less likely to generate their own electrical signals. When evaluated as a treatment, tDCS is typically done in daily sessions over a period of two weeks.\nOne of the challenges of tDCS is to work out the best possible positioning of electrodes and direction of electricity flow to gradually cause lasting changes in brain activity in ways that might be expected to improve depression. To address this challenge, the investigators are using MRI to take pictures of the brain during tDCS. This data will help us better understand the short-term effects of tDCS in depression and help us learn how to customize future treatments to cause a lasting beneficial response.\nPatients with depression between the ages of 20-55 years are eligible to take part in this research. Potential participants will undergo:\nAn assessment to confirm eligibility. This will take place over a secure videoconference call lasting no more than 3 hours.\nTwo in-person study visits lasting 30 min and 2-1/2 hours respectively. In the first visit, the investigators will use the MRI to take a picture of the brain and head structure to determine appropriate locations for placing the tDCS electrodes at the start of the second visit. Following electrode placement, an MRI scan will be performed to take pictures of the brain during tDCS. Depending on the study arm,\nParticipants may receive 'active' or 'sham' tDCS. The 'sham' condition is identical to the 'active' tDCS in every way except that it involves minimal tDCS and is designed to help rule out effects unrelated to the administered tDCS electricity. Participants may also be asked to perform a mental task during MRI.\nAll participants will be compensated $150 + parking upon completion of all study-visits."},

People with schizophrenia may seem like they have lost touch with reality, which can be distressing for them and for their family and friends. The symptoms of schizophrenia can make it difficult to participate in usual, everyday activities, but effective treatments are available.

{"title": "Schizophrenia", "heading": "What are the signs and symptoms of schizophrenia?", "text": "\n  \nWhat are the signs and symptoms of schizophrenia?\n\n  \n    \n\n\nIt’s important to recognize the symptoms of schizophrenia and seek help as early as possible. People with schizophrenia are usually diagnosed between the ages of 16 and 30, after the first episode of \npsychosis: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/understanding-psychosis \n\n. Starting treatment as soon as possible following the first episode of psychosis: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/understanding-psychosis \n is an important step toward recovery. However, research shows that gradual changes in thinking, mood, and social functioning often appear before the first episode of psychosis: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/understanding-psychosis \n. Schizophrenia is rare in younger children.\n\n\n\nSchizophrenia symptoms can differ from person to person, but they generally fall into three main categories: psychotic, negative, and cognitive.\n\n\n\nPsychotic symptoms\n include changes in the way a person thinks, acts, and experiences the world. People with psychotic symptoms may lose a shared sense of reality with others and experience the world in a distorted way. For some people, these symptoms come and go. For others, the symptoms become stable over time. Psychotic symptoms include:\n\n\n\nHallucinations\n: When a person sees, hears, smells, tastes, or feels things that are not actually there. Hearing voices is common for people with schizophrenia. People who hear voices may hear them for a long time before family or friends notice a problem.\n\n\t\nDelusions\n: When a person has strong beliefs that are not true and may seem irrational to others. For example, individuals experiencing delusions may believe that people on the radio and television are sending special messages that require a certain response, or they may believe that they are in danger or that others are trying to hurt them.\n\n\t\nThought disorder\n: When a person has ways of thinking that are unusual or illogical. People with thought disorder may have trouble organizing their thoughts and speech. Sometimes a person will stop talking in the middle of a thought, jump from topic to topic, or make up words that have no meaning.\n\n\t\nMovement disorder\n: When a person exhibits abnormal body movements. People with movement disorder may repeat certain motions over and over.\n\n\nNegative symptoms\n include loss of motivation, loss of interest or enjoyment in daily activities, withdrawal from social life, difficulty showing emotions, and difficulty functioning normally.\n\n\n\nNegative symptoms include:\n\n\n\nHaving trouble planning and sticking with activities, such as grocery shopping\n\n\t\nHaving trouble anticipating and feeling pleasure in everyday life\n\n\t\nTalking in a dull voice and showing limited facial expression\n\n\t\nAvoiding social interaction or interacting in socially awkward ways\n\n\t\nHaving very low energy and spending a lot of time in passive activities. In extreme cases, a person might stop moving or talking for a while, which is a rare condition called catatonia\n.\n\n\nThese symptoms are sometimes mistaken for symptoms of depression or other mental illnesses.\n\n\n\nCognitive symptoms\n include problems in attention, concentration, and memory. These symptoms can make it hard to follow a conversation, learn new things, or remember appointments. A person’s level of cognitive functioning is one of the best predictors of their day-to-day functioning. Health care providers evaluate cognitive functioning using specific tests.\n\n\n\nCognitive symptoms include:\n\n\n\nHaving trouble processing information to make decisions\n\n\t\nHaving trouble using information immediately after learning it\n\n\t\nHaving trouble focusing or paying attention\n\n\nThe \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html \n \n has recognized that having certain mental disorders, including depression and schizophrenia, can make people more likely to get severely ill from COVID-19. Learn more about \ngetting help and finding a health care provider: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/find-help \n\n.\n\n\n\nRisk of violence\n\n\n\nMost people with schizophrenia are not violent. Overall, people with schizophrenia are more likely than those without the illness to be harmed by others. For people with schizophrenia, the risk of self-harm and of violence to others is greatest when the illness is untreated. It is important to help people who are showing symptoms to get treatment as quickly as possible.\n\n\n\nSchizophrenia vs. dissociative identity disorder\n\n\n\nAlthough some of the signs may seem similar on the surface, schizophrenia is not dissociative identity disorder (which used to be called multiple personality disorder or split personality). People with dissociative identity disorder have two or more distinct identities that are present and that alternately take control of them.\n\n\n\n\n"},
{"title": "Schizophrenia", "heading": "What are the risk factors for schizophrenia?", "text": "\n  \nWhat are the risk factors for schizophrenia?\n\n  \n    \n\n\nSeveral factors may contribute to a person’s risk of developing schizophrenia.\n\n\n\nGenetics:\n Schizophrenia sometimes runs in families. However, just because one family member has schizophrenia, it does not mean that other members of the family also will have it. \nStudies suggest that many different genes may increase a person’s chances of developing schizophrenia: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/messages/2020/piecing-together-the-genetic-puzzle-of-schizophrenia \n\n, but that no single gene causes the disorder by itself.\n\n\n\nEnvironment:\n Research suggests that a combination of genetic factors and aspects of a person’s environment and life experiences may play a role in the development of schizophrenia. These environmental factors that may include living in poverty, stressful or dangerous surroundings, and exposure to viruses or nutritional problems before birth.\n\n\n\nBrain structure and function:\n Research shows that people with schizophrenia may be more likely to have differences in the size of certain brain areas and in connections between brain areas. Some of these brain differences may develop before birth. Researchers are working to better understand how brain structure and function may relate to schizophrenia.\n\n\n\n\n"},
{"title": "Schizophrenia", "heading": "How is schizophrenia treated?", "text": "\n  \nHow is schizophrenia treated?\n\n  \n    \n\n\nCurrent treatments for schizophrenia focus on helping people manage their symptoms, improve day-to-day functioning, and achieve personal life goals, such as completing education, pursuing a career, and having fulfilling relationships.\n\n\n\nAntipsychotic medications\n\n\n\nAntipsychotic medications can help make psychotic symptoms less intense and less frequent. These medications are usually taken every day in a pill or liquid forms. Some antipsychotic medications are given as injections once or twice a month.\n\n\n\nIf a person’s symptoms do not improve with usual antipsychotic medications, they may be prescribed clozapine. People who take clozapine must have regular blood tests to check for a potentially dangerous side effect that occurs in 1-2% of patients.\n\n\n\nPeople respond to antipsychotic medications in different ways. It is important to report any side effects to a health care provider. Many people taking antipsychotic medications experience side effects such as weight gain, dry mouth, restlessness, and drowsiness when they start taking these medications. Some of these side effects may go away over time, while others may last.\n\n\n\nShared decision making: https://www.samhsa.gov/brss-tacs/recovery-support-tools/shared-decision-making \n \n between health care providers and patients is the recommended strategy for determining the best type of medication or medication combination and the right dose. To find the latest information about antipsychotic medications, talk to a health care provider and visit the \nU.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website: https://www.fda.gov/ \n \n.\n\n\n\nPsychosocial treatments\n\n\n\nPsychosocial treatments help people find solutions to everyday challenges and manage symptoms while attending school, working, and forming relationships. These treatments are often used together with antipsychotic medication. People who participate in regular psychosocial treatment are less likely to have symptoms reoccur or to be hospitalized.\n\n\n\nExamples of this kind of treatment include \ntypes of psychotherapy: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/psychotherapies \n\n such as cognitive behavioral therapy, behavioral skills training, supported employment, and cognitive remediation interventions.\n\n\n\nEducation and support\n\n\n\nEducational programs can help family and friends learn about symptoms of schizophrenia, treatment options, and strategies for helping loved ones with the illness. These programs can help friends and family manage their distress, boost their own coping skills, and strengthen their ability to provide support. The National Alliance on Mental Illness website has more information about \nsupport groups and education: https://www.nami.org/Support-Education \n\n \n.\n\n\n\nCoordinated specialty care\n\n\n\nCoordinated specialty care (CSC) programs: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-funded-by-nimh/research-initiatives/recovery-after-an-initial-schizophrenia-episode-raise \n\n are recovery-focused programs for people with first episode psychosis, an early stage of schizophrenia. Health care providers and specialists work together as a team to provide CSC, which includes psychotherapy, medication, case management, employment and education support, and family education and support. The treatment team works collaboratively with the individual to make treatment decisions, involving family members as much as possible.\n\n\n\nCompared with typical care, CSC is more effective at reducing symptoms, improving quality of life, and increasing involvement in work or school.\n\n\n\nAssertive community treatment\n\n\n\nAssertive community treatment (ACT): https://www.samhsa.gov/resource/ebp/assertive-community-treatment-act-evidence-based-practices-ebp-kit \n \n is designed especially for people with schizophrenia who are likely to experience multiple hospitalizations or homelessness. ACT is usually delivered by a team of health care providers who work together to provide care to patients in the community.\n\n\n\nTreatment for drug and alcohol misuse\n\n\n\nIt is common for people with schizophrenia to have problems with drugs and alcohol. A treatment program that includes treatment for both schizophrenia and substance use is important for recovery because substance use can interfere with treatment for schizophrenia.\n\n\n\n\n"},

They are called microRNA because their size is much smaller than typical RNA molecules. miRNAs are highly responsive to environment. This responsiveness is reflected in their expression in individuals who are affected by environment such as stress. The investigators are gathering genetic material, including DNA and RNA, from each participant. The RNA will be taken from the small vesicles and cells in the participant's blood and analyzed.

Qualitative data show that cultural factors-lack of relatability, representation, and perceived stigma regarding mental health treatment-limit engagement with digital CBT programs. Population-and setting-specific adaptations to interventions can lead to their successful implementation and wider use. The investigators will work with a digital CBT program to decrease stigma and make it more relatable and relevant to young adults with SCD, by devising changes to advertising and promotion, and tailoring communication with an integrated health coach, Aim 1: Use implementation science (ImS) and human-centered design methods to define the barriers to delivering routine mental health screening and digital CBT to adolescents and young adults with SCD. Aim 2: Rapidly iterate, test, and evaluate adaptations to the implementation strategy for a coach-enhanced digital mental health service. Aim 3: Demonstrate that a population-specific implementation strategy improves engagement with a digital CBT-based mental health service.\nThe investigators will capitalize on our mobile technology tools, interdisciplinary expertise, and community-based partnerships to investigate the implementation of digital CBT into low-resource clinics and community-based organizations serving adolescents and adults with sickle cell disease."},

The hippocampus has a high concentration of glucocorticoid receptors (GCRs), and the pre-clinical literature demonstrates shortening of apical dendrites in the CA3 region of the hippocampus and decreased neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) following CS administration. In humans, both stress and CS exposure are associated with a decline in declarative memory performance (a process mediated by the hippocampus). Impairment in declarative memory and hippocampal atrophy are reported in patients with excessive CS release due to Cushing's disease, and, by our group, in patients receiving prescription CS therapy. These findings have important implications for patients with mood disorders, as a large subset of people with major depressive disorder (MDD) show evidence of HPA axis activation, elevated cortisol and, importantly, resistance to the effects of CSs on both the HPA axis and on declarative memory. Thus, resistance to corticosteroids appears to be a consequence of MDD.\nthis study will examine changes in declarative memory, as well as use state-of-the-art high-resolution multimodal neuroimaging, including structural and functional (i.e., task-based and resting state) MRI, in both men and women healthy controls, and, as an exploratory aim, a depressed group, given 3-day exposures to hydrocortisone (160 mg/day) or placebo. The study will translate preclinical findings to humans, provide valuable data on possible sex differences in the response to cortisol and, for the first time, identify specific hippocampal subfields (e.g., CA3/DG) in humans that are most sensitive to acute CS effects. Using resting state fMRI data and whole brain connectomics using graph theoretical approaches, we will determine the effects of cortisol exposure on functional brain networks. Furthermore, this will be the first study to use neuroimaging to compare the brain's response to CSs in people with depression vs. controls, and determine whether depressed people demonstrate glucocorticoid resistance within the hippocampus. We hypothesize that hippocampal response to acute CSs will be greatest in the CA3/DG subfield, greater in women than in men, and that depressed people will show a blunted hippocampal response to CSs compared to controls. A multidisciplinary research team with extensive experience in CS effects on the brain and hippocampal subfield neuroimaging, and a prior history of research collaboration, will conduct the project."},

A family history of an alcohol use disorder (Family History Positive, FHP) is one of the strongest identified predictors of an improved antidepressant response to ketamine. Like ketamine, alcohol is a functional NMDA receptor antagonist. FHP is associated with differential response to both alcohol, e.g. decreased body sway and plasma cortisol, and ketamine, e.g. blunted psychotomimetic side effects. One of the primary mechanistic hypotheses for ketamine's antidepressant action is the acute intrasynaptic release of glutamate from major output neurons, e.g. cortical pyramidal cells. Preliminary clinical studies have demonstrated this acute glutamate \"surge\" in response to subanesthetic dose ketamine. Based on these findings, the investigators hypothesize that ketamine's enhanced antidepressant efficacy in FHP TRD subjects is, at least in part, attributable to increased glutamate release relative to TRD subjects without a family history of alcohol use disorder (Family History Negative, FHN). The investigators also hypothesize that alcohol similarly augments glutamate release in this bio- logically-enriched subgroup, which may be a more objective biomarker than family history status. To test these hypotheses, the investigators have designed a now two-site, open-label study of 21-65 year old medically and neurologically healthy, currently moderately-to-severely depressed TRD patients. In total, the investigators plan to recruit 25 FHP and 25 FHN TRD subjects. All subjects must not have a lifetime substance use disorder (except nicotine or caffeine), no lifetime history of an alcohol use disorder and socially drink. The experimental portion consists of two phases. The preliminary first phase is a medication taper (if needed) and psychotropic medication-free period. The experimental second phase comprises two pharmacokinetically-defined basal-bolus alcohol and one subanesthetic dose (0.5mg/kg x 40 minute) ketamine infusions. The first alcohol infusion will establish the pharmacokinetic profile for a subsequent alcohol infusion occurring during 7T-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), both resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to detect glutamate in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex/ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vmPFC/vACC). The ketamine infusion will also occur during 7T-MRI. The primary outcome measure is group mean change in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score from pre-ketamine infusion (baseline) to one week post-infusion, where the investigators observed ketamine's greatest antidepressant effect in FHP TRD. Additional outcome measures are vmPFC/vACC glutamate change in response to ketamine and alcohol challenge based on family history status. In summary, this study will provide key mechanistic information on ketamine's improved antidepressant efficacy in a biologically-enriched subgroup. This will contribute to the systematic development of more efficacious, personalized treatments for major depression in an effort to reduce its enormous public health burden."},

Candidates are screened by phone with questions about their psychiatric and medical history, current emotional state and sleep pattern, and family history of psychiatric disorders. Candidates who pass the preliminary screening then undergo additional screening interviews and laboratory tests.\nParticipants undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neuropsychological testing, as follows:\n\"<TAB>MRI scans: Subjects are asked to participate in an MRI study on one of several scanners to measure blood flow in the brain, concentrations of certain chemicals in the brain, or magnetic properties of the brain. MRI uses a strong magnet and radio waves to obtain pictures of the brain. The subject lies still on a narrow bed with a metal coil close to the head. For this study, subjects may be asked to wear a special coil on the neck to help measure blood flow. They may be asked to watch a screen presenting images or to do a task in which they respond to pictures or sounds and may be asked to return for additional scans.\n\"<TAB>Neuropsychological testing: Subjects may undergo tests of cognitive performance. Often, people with mood disorders have subtle changes in performance on these tests that allow researchers to pinpoint where brain abnormalities occur.

The relationship between temperament and risk or resilience may reflect the influences of brain activity on behavior at different stages of childhood development. Behavioral inhibition and mood or anxiety disorders have been linked to disturbances in the circuitry of several areas in the brain. However, the involvement of this circuitry in temperament remains unclear. This study will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the function of different parts of the brain in children who have previously undergone temperament studies and have had their temperaments classified.\nTwo sets of studies will be performed in the current protocol. A small set of pilot studies will be performed in infants, by staff at the University of Maryland. In terms of the studies among infants, these subjects will initially be contacted by staff at Maryland and then will be seen at the NIH for up to three visits lasting between 4- to 5- hours during the first year of life.

The primary goal of the project is to document, in pediatric anxiety disorders and major depression, perturbations in brain systems mediating attention biases, fear conditioning, emotional memory, and response to various forms of motivational stimuli. As one secondary goal, the project measures the relationship between these factors and treatment response to either fluoxetine, a specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), or interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT). Another secondary goal examines similar associations in adults.\nStudy Population: A total of 2530 children, adolescents, and adults will be recruited. Most subjects will not be able to complete all procedures. We seek to comprehensively study 150 juveniles with only a current anxiety disorder, 60 juveniles with current major depression, 150 juveniles with no psychiatric disorder, 100 adults with major depression, 60 adults with an anxiety disorder, and 150 adults with no psychiatric disorder. To achieve this, we are recruiting 2530 individuals.\nDesign: Subjects will be tested using fMRI paradigms designed to examine brain regions engaged when processing motivationally salient stimuli, as assessed during attention, memory, social interaction, reward, and fear-conditioning paradigms. After these initial fMRI tests, subjects with depression or an anxiety disorder receive treatment. Treatment will comprise open treatment with either fluoxetine or CBT, augmented with computer-based attention retraining, delivered in a randomized-controlled design, with random assignment to either active or placebo attentiontraining regimens. Adolescent subjects then will be re-tested after eight-weeks using only the attention, memory, and conditioning paradigms.\nOutcome Measures: Prior imaging studies note that tasks requiring attention modulation, emotional memory, social interchange, and fear conditioning engage brain regions previously implicated in adult mood and anxiety disorders. These regions include most consistently the amygdala and ventral prefrontal cortex. Moreover, imaging studies of reward function implicate the striatum and prefrontal cortex in adult mood disorders. As a result, we hypothesize that attention, memory, social interaction, reward, and conditioning paradigms will engage the amygdala, ventral prefrontal cortex and striatum in both psychiatrically healthy and impaired subjects. Moreover, we hypothesize that these healthy and psychiatrically impaired groups will differ in the degree of engagement.\nJuvenile subjects also will be treated for eight-weeks, and a subset will be re-tested with fMRI. We predict that pre-treatment abnormalities in neural circuitry will predict response to treatment, such that increased amygdala and prefrontal activation will occur in individuals who show the strongest response to treatment. Moreover, we hypothesize that effective treatment will normalize abnormalities in attention and emotional memory, as manifest in fMRI."},

While there has been much speculation about possible biologically based etiologies for postpartum disorders (PPD), none has ever been confirmed. Preliminary results from two related studies (protocols 90-M-0088, 92-M-0174) provide evidence that women with menstrual cycle related mood disorder, but not controls, experience mood disturbances during exogenous replacement of physiologic levels of gonadal steroids. The present protocol is designed to create a \"scaled-down\" hormonal milieu of pregnancy and the puerperium in order to determine whether women who have had a previous episode of postpartum major effective episode will experience differential mood and behavioral effects compared with controls and to determine whether it is the abrupt withdrawal of gonadal steroids or the prolonged exposure to gonadal steroids that is associated with mood symptoms. Supraphysiologic plasma levels of gonadal steroids will be established, maintained, and then rapidly reduced, simulating the hormonal events that occur during pregnancy and parturition. This will be accomplished by administering estradiol and progesterone to women who are pretreated with a gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist (Lupron). After eight weeks, administration of gonadal steroids will be stopped in one group of patients and controls, and a sudden decline in the plasma hormone levels will be precipitated. Another group will be maintained on supraphysiologic levels of estrogen and progesterone for an additional month. Outcome measures will include mood, behavioral and hormonal parameters (a separate protocol done in collaboration with NICHD)."},

A mental health professional who has experience helping people with PTSD, such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or clinical social worker, can determine whether symptoms meet the criteria for PTSD.\n\n\n\nTo be diagnosed with PTSD, an adult must have all of the following for at least 1 month:\n\n\n\nAt least one re-experiencing symptom\n\n\t\nAt least one avoidance symptom\n\n\t\nAt least two arousal and reactivity symptoms\n\n\t\nAt least two cognition and mood symptoms\n\n\nRe-experiencing symptoms include:\n\n\n\nExperiencing flashbacks—reliving the traumatic event, including physical symptoms such as a racing heart or sweating\n\n\t\nHaving recurring memories or dreams related to the event\n\n\t\nHaving distressing thoughts\n\n\t\nExperiencing physical signs of stress\n\n\nThoughts and feelings can trigger these symptoms, as can words, objects, or situations that are reminders of the event.\n\n\n\nAvoidance symptoms include:\n\n\n\nStaying away from places, events, or objects that are reminders of the traumatic experience\n\n\t\nAvoiding thoughts or feelings related to the traumatic event\n\n\nAvoidance symptoms may cause people to change their routines. For example, some people may avoid driving or riding in a car after a serious car accident.\n\n\n\nArousal and reactivity symptoms include:\n\n\n\nBeing easily startled\n\n\t\nFeeling tense, on guard, or on edge\n\n\t\nHaving difficulty concentrating\n\n\t\nHaving difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep\n\n\t\nFeeling irritable and having angry or aggressive outbursts\n\n\t\nEngaging in risky, reckless, or destructive behavior\n\n\nArousal symptoms are often constant. They can lead to feelings of stress and anger and may interfere with parts of daily life, such as sleeping, eating, or concentrating.\n\n\n\nCognition and mood symptoms include:\n\n\n\nHaving trouble remembering key features of the traumatic event\n\n\t\nHaving negative thoughts about oneself or the world\n\n\t\nHaving exaggerated feelings of blame directed toward oneself or others\n\n\t\nHaving ongoing negative emotions, such as fear, anger, guilt, or shame\n\n\t\nLosing interest in enjoyable activities\n\n\t\nHaving feelings of social isolation\n\n\t\nHaving difficulty feeling positive emotions, such as happiness or satisfaction\n\n\nCognition and mood symptoms can begin or worsen after the traumatic event. They can lead a person to feel detached from friends or family members.\n\n\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling or having thoughts of suicide, call or text the \n988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline: https://988lifeline.org: https://988lifeline.org/chat/ \n/ \n\n \n at \n988 \nor chat at \n988lifeline.org: https://988lifeline.org/chat/ \n\n \n. In life-threatening situations, call \n911\n.\n\n\n\nHow do children and teens react to trauma?\n\n\n\nChildren and teens can have extreme reactions to trauma, but some of their symptoms may not be the same as those seen in adults. In children younger than age 6, these symptoms can include:\n\n\n\nWetting the bed after having learned to use the toilet\n\n\t\nForgetting how to talk or being unable to talk\n\n\t\nActing out the scary event during playtime\n\n\t\nBeing unusually clingy with a parent or other adult\n\n\nOlder children and teens usually show symptoms more like those seen in adults. They also may develop disruptive, disrespectful, or destructive behaviors. Older children and teens may feel guilty for not preventing injury or deaths. They may also have thoughts of revenge.\n\n\n\nLearn more about how to \nhelp children and adolescents cope with disasters and other traumatic events: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/helping-children-and-adolescents-cope-with-disasters-and-other-traumatic-events \n\n.\n\n\n\n\n"},

{"title": "Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder", "heading": "How is PTSD treated?", "text": "\n  \nHow is PTSD treated?\n\n  \n    \n\n  \nIt is important for anyone with PTSD symptoms to work with a mental health professional who has experience treating PTSD. The main treatments are psychotherapy, medications, or a combination of psychotherapy and medications. A mental health professional can help people find the best treatment plan for their symptoms and needs.\n  \n\n  \nSome people with PTSD, such as those in abusive relationships, may be living through ongoing trauma. In these cases, treatment is usually most effective when it addresses both the traumatic situation and the symptoms of PTSD. People who experience traumatic events or who have PTSD also may experience \npanic disorder: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/anxiety-disorders \n\n, \ndepression: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/depression \n\n, \nsubstance use: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/substance-use-and-mental-health \n\n, or \nsuicidal thoughts: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/suicide-prevention \n\n. Treatment for these conditions can help with recovery after trauma. Research shows that support from family and friends also can be an important part of recovery.\n  \n\n  \nPsychotherapy: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/psychotherapies \n\n  \n\n  \nPsychotherapy: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/psychotherapies \n\n (sometimes called talk therapy) includes a variety of treatment techniques that mental health professionals use to help people identify and change troubling emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. Psychotherapy: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/psychotherapies \n can provide support, education, and guidance to people with PTSD and their families. Treatment can take place one on one or in a group and usually lasts 6 to 12 weeks but can last longer.\n  \n\n  \nSome types of psychotherapy target PTSD symptoms, while others focus on social, family, or job-related problems. Effective psychotherapies often emphasize a few key components, including learning skills to help identify triggers and manage symptoms.\n  \n\n  \nOne common type of psychotherapy, called cognitive behavioral therapy, can include exposure therapy and cognitive restructuring:\n  \n\n  \nExposure therapy \nhelps people learn to manage their fear by gradually exposing them, in a safe way, to the trauma they experienced. As part of exposure therapy, people may think or write about the trauma or visit the place where it happened. This therapy can help people with PTSD reduce symptoms that cause them distress.\n\n    \nCognitive restructuring\n helps people make sense of the traumatic event. Sometimes people remember the event differently from how it happened. They may feel guilt or shame about something that is not their fault. Cognitive restructuring can help people with PTSD think about what happened in a realistic way.\n\n  \nMedications\n  \n\n  \nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved two selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), a type of antidepressant medication, for the treatment of PTSD. SSRIs may help manage PTSD symptoms such as sadness, worry, anger, and feeling emotionally numb. Health care providers may prescribe \nSSRIs and other medications: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/mental-health-medications \n\n along with psychotherapy. Some medications may help treat specific PTSD symptoms, such as sleep problems and nightmares.\n  \n\n  \nPeople should work with their health care providers to find the best medication or combination of medications and the right dose. To find the latest information about medications, talk to a health care provider and visit the \nFDA website: https://www.fda.gov/ \n \n.\n  \n\n\n\n\n"},

Eating disorders are actually serious and often fatal illnesses that are associated with severe disturbances in people’s eating behaviors and related thoughts and emotions. Preoccupation with food, body weight, and shape may also signal an eating disorder. Common eating disorders include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder.\n\n\n\n\n"},
{"title": "Eating Disorders", "heading": "Signs and symptoms", "text": "\n  \nSigns and symptoms\n\n  \n    \n\n\nAnorexia nervosa\n\n\n\nAnorexia nervosa is a condition where people avoid food, severely restrict food, or eat very small quantities of only certain foods. They also may weigh themselves repeatedly. Even when dangerously underweight, they may see themselves as overweight.\n\n\n\nThere are two subtypes of anorexia nervosa: a \"restrictive\n\" \nsubtype and a \"binge-purge\n\"\n subtype.\n\n\n\nIn the \nrestrictive\n subtype of anorexia nervosa, people severely limit the amount and type of food they consume.\n\n\t\nIn the \nbinge-purge\n subtype of anorexia nervosa, people also greatly restrict the amount and type of food they consume. In addition, they may have binge-eating and purging episodes—eating large amounts of food in a short time followed by vomiting or using laxatives or diuretics to get rid of what was consumed.\n\n\nAnorexia nervosa can be fatal.\n It has an extremely high death (mortality) rate compared with other mental disorders. People with anorexia are at risk of dying from medical complications associated with starvation. Suicide is the second leading cause of death for people diagnosed with anorexia nervosa.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling or having thoughts of suicide, call or text the \n988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline: https://988lifeline.org: https://988lifeline.org/ \n/ \n\n \n at \n988 \nor chat at \n988lifeline.org: https://988lifeline.org/ \n\n \n. In life-threatening situations, call 911.\n\n\n\n\n\nSymptoms include:\n\n\n\nExtremely restricted eating\n\n\t\nExtreme thinness (emaciation)\n\n\t\nA relentless pursuit of thinness and unwillingness to maintain a normal or healthy weight\n\n\t\nIntense fear of gaining weight\n\n\t\nDistorted body image, a self-esteem that is heavily influenced by perceptions of body weight and shape, or a denial of the seriousness of low body weight\n\n\nOther symptoms may develop over time, including:\n\n\n\nThinning of the bones (osteopenia or osteoporosis)\n\n\t\nMild anemia and muscle wasting and weakness\n\n\t\nBrittle hair and nails\n\n\t\nDry and yellowish skin\n\n\t\nGrowth of fine hair all over the body (lanugo)\n\n\t\nSevere constipation\n\n\t\nLow blood pressure\n\n\t\nSlowed breathing and pulse\n\n\t\nDamage to the structure and function of the heart\n\n\t\nBrain damage\n\n\t\nMultiorgan failure\n\n\t\nDrop in internal body temperature, causing a person to feel cold all the time\n\n\t\nLethargy, sluggishness, or feeling tired all the time\n\n\t\nInfertility\n\n\nBulimia nervosa\n\n\n\nBulimia nervosa is a condition where people have recurrent and frequent episodes of eating unusually large amounts of food and feeling a lack of control over these episodes. This binge-eating is followed by behavior that compensates for the overeating such as forced vomiting, excessive use of laxatives or diuretics, fasting, excessive exercise, or a combination of these behaviors. People with bulimia nervosa may be slightly underweight, normal weight, or over overweight.\n\n\n\nSymptoms include:\n\n\n\nChronically inflamed and sore throat\n\n\t\nSwollen salivary glands in the neck and jaw area\n\n\t\nWorn tooth enamel and increasingly sensitive and decaying teeth as a result of exposure to stomach acid\n\n\t\nAcid reflux disorder and other gastrointestinal problems\n\n\t\nIntestinal distress and irritation from laxative abuse\n\n\t\nSevere dehydration from purging of fluids\n\n\t\nElectrolyte imbalance (too low or too high levels of sodium, calcium, potassium, and other minerals) which can lead to stroke or heart attack\n\n\nBinge-eating disorder\n\n\n\nBinge-eating disorder is a condition where people lose control over their eating and have reoccurring episodes of eating unusually large amounts of food. Unlike bulimia nervosa, periods of binge-eating are not followed by purging, excessive exercise, or fasting. As a result, people with binge-eating disorder often are overweight or obese. Binge-eating disorder is the most common eating disorder in the U.S.\n\n\n\nSymptoms include:\n\n\n\nEating unusually large amounts of food in a specific amount of time, such as a 2-hour period\n\n\t\nEating even when you're full or not hungry\n\n\t\nEating fast during binge episodes\n\n\t\nEating until you're uncomfortably full\n\n\t\nEating alone or in secret to avoid embarrassment\n\n\t\nFeeling distressed, ashamed, or guilty about your eating\n\n\t\nFrequently dieting, possibly without weight loss\n\n\nAvoidant restrictive food intake disorder\n\n\n\nAvoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), previously known as selective eating disorder, is a condition where people limit the amount or type of food eaten. Unlike anorexia nervosa, people with ARFID do not have a distorted body image or extreme fear of gaining weight. ARFID is most common in middle childhood and usually has an earlier onset than other eating disorders. Many children go through phases of picky eating, but a child with ARFID does not eat enough calories to grow and develop properly, and an adult with ARFID does not eat enough calories to maintain basic body function.\n\n\n\nSymptoms include:\n\n\n\nDramatic restriction of types or amount of food eaten\n\n\t\nLack of appetite or interest in food\n\n\t\nDramatic weight loss\n\n\t\nUpset stomach, abdominal pain, or other gastrointestinal issues with no other known cause\n\n\t\nLimited range of preferred foods that becomes even more limited (“picky eating” that gets progressively worse)\n\n\n\n\n"},

{"title": "Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder", "heading": "Treatment and therapies", "text": "\n  \nTreatment and therapies\n\n  \n    \n\n\nRelatively few DMDD-specific treatment studies have been conducted to date. Treatment is often based on what has been helpful for other disorders associated with irritability, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), and anxiety disorders.\n\n\n\nTreatment for DMDD generally includes certain types of \npsychotherapy: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/psychotherapies \n\n (also called talk therapy) and sometimes medications: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/mental-health-medications \n. In many cases, psychotherapy: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/psychotherapies \n is considered first, with medication added later if needed. However, in some cases, providers recommend that children receive both psychotherapy: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/psychotherapies \n and medication at the start of their treatment. Parents or caregivers should work closely with their child's health care provider to make treatment decisions that are best for their child.\n\n\n\nThe National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is currently funding studies focused on further improving these treatments and identifying new treatments to address irritability and temper outbursts.\n\n\n\nPsychotherapies\n\n\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)\n targets the relationship between thoughts, behaviors, and feelings and is often effective in treating anger and disruptive behavior. CBT for anger and disruptive behavior focuses on changing maladaptive thoughts. Researchers are also using CBT to help children increase their ability to tolerate frustration without having an outburst. This therapy teaches coping skills for controlling anger and ways to identify and re-label the distorted perceptions that contribute to outbursts.\n\n\n\nDialectical behavior therapy for children (DBT-C) \nteaches children skills that may help them regulate their emotions and avoid extreme or prolonged outbursts. In DBT-C, the clinician helps children learn skills that can help with regulating their moods and emotions.\n\n\n\nParent training\n teaches parents or caregivers more effective ways to respond to irritable behavior, such as anticipating events that might lead a child to have a temper outburst and working ahead to avert it. Training also focuses on the importance of predictable and consistent responses to a child’s outbursts and rewards for positive behavior.\n\n\n\nMedications\n\n\n\nCurrently, no medications: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/mental-health-medications \n are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) specifically for treating children or adolescents with DMDD. However, health care providers may prescribe certain \nmedications: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/mental-health-medications \n\n—such as stimulants, antidepressants, and atypical antipsychotics—to help relieve a child’s DMDD symptoms.\n\n\n\nStimulants\n are often used to treat ADHD, and research suggests that stimulant medications: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/mental-health-medications \n also may decrease irritability in youth.\n\n\t\nAntidepressants\n are sometimes used to treat irritability and mood problems children with DMDD may experience. One study suggests that the antidepressant citalopram, combined with the stimulant methylphenidate, can decrease irritability in youth with DMDD. \nPlease note\n: Antidepressants may increase suicidal thoughts and behaviors in youth, who should be monitored closely by their health care provider.\n\n\t\nCertain \natypical antipsychotic medications: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/mental-health-medications \n\n are used to treat children with irritability, severe outbursts, or aggression. FDA has approved these medications: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/mental-health-medications \n for the treatment of irritability associated with autism, and they are sometimes used to treat DMDD, too. However, due to the side effects associated with these medications: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/mental-health-medications \n, they are often used only when other approaches have not been successful.\n\n\nAll medications: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/mental-health-medications \n have side effects.

Depression that begins during pregnancy is prenatal depression and depression that begins after the baby is born is postpartum depression.\nSeasonal affective disorder\n is depression that comes and goes with the seasons, with symptoms typically starting in the late fall and early winter and going away during the spring and summer.\nDepression with symptoms of psychosis\n is a severe form of depression in which a person experiences psychosis symptoms, such as delusions (disturbing, false fixed beliefs) or hallucinations (hearing or seeing things others do not hear or see).\nPeople with \nbipolar disorder\n (formerly called manic depression or manic-depressive illness) also experience depressive episodes, during which they feel sad, indifferent, or hopeless, combined with a very low activity level. But a person with bipolar disorder also experiences manic (or less severe hypomanic) episodes, or unusually elevated moods, in which they might feel very happy, irritable, or “up,” with a marked increase in activity level.\nOther types of depressive disorders found in the \nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)\n \n include \ndisruptive mood dysregulation disorder: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/disruptive-mood-dysregulation-disorder-dmdd/disruptive-mood-dysregulation-disorder \n\n (diagnosed in children and adolescents) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (that affects women around the time of their period).\n\n"},

Some people experience only a few symptoms, while others experience many symptoms. Symptoms associated with depression interfere with day-to-day functioning and cause significant distress for the person experiencing them.\nDepression can also involve other changes in mood or behavior that include:\nIncreased anger or irritability\nFeeling restless or on edge\nBecoming withdrawn, negative, or detached\nIncreased engagement in high-risk activities\nGreater impulsivity\nIncreased use of alcohol or drugs\nIsolating from family and friends\nInability to meet the responsibilities of work and family or ignoring other important roles\nProblems with sexual desire and performance\nDepression can look different in men and women. Although men, women, and people of all genders can feel depressed, how they express those symptoms and the behaviors they use to cope with them may differ. For example, some men (as well as women) may show symptoms other than sadness, instead seeming angry or irritable. And although increased use of alcohol or drugs can be a coping strategy for any person with depression, men may be more likely to use alcohol or drugs to help them cope.\nIn some cases, mental health symptoms appear as physical problems. For example, a racing heart, tightened chest, ongoing headaches, or digestive issues. Men are often more likely to see a health care provider about these physical symptoms than their emotional ones.\nBecause depression tends to make people think more negatively about themselves and the world, some people may also have thoughts of suicide or self-harm.\nSeveral persistent symptoms, in addition to low mood, are required for a diagnosis of depression, but people with only a few symptoms may also benefit from treatment. The severity and frequency of symptoms and how long they last will vary depending on the person, the illness, and the stage of the illness.\nIf you experience signs or symptoms of depression and they persist or do not go away, talk to a health care provider.

People who use esketamine will usually continue taking an oral antidepressant to maintain the improvement in their symptoms.\n\n\n\nAnother option for treatment-resistant depression is to take an antidepressant alongside a different type of medication: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/mental-health-medications \n that may make the antidepressant more effective, such as an antipsychotic or anticonvulsant medication: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/mental-health-medications \n. Further research is needed to identify the best role of these newer medication: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/mental-health-medications \ns in routine practice.\n\n\n\nIf you begin taking an antidepressant, \ndo not stop taking it without talking to a health care provider\n. Sometimes people taking antidepressants feel better and stop taking the medication: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/mental-health-medications \ns on their own, and their depression symptoms return. When you and your health care provider have decided it is time to stop a medication: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/mental-health-medications \n, usually after a course of 9–12 months, the provider will help you slowly and safely decrease your dose. Abruptly stopping a medication: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/mental-health-medications \n can cause withdrawal symptoms.\n\n\n\nNote\n: In some cases, children, teenagers, and young adults under 25 years may experience an increase in suicidal thoughts or behavior when taking antidepressants, especially in the first few weeks after starting or when the dose is changed. The FDA advises that patients of all ages taking antidepressants be watched closely, especially during the first few weeks of treatment.\n\n\n\nIf you are considering taking an antidepressant and are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding, talk to a health care provider about any health risks to you or your unborn or nursing child and how to weigh those risks against the benefits of available treatment options.\n\n\n\nTo find the latest information about antidepressants, talk to a health care provider and visit the \nFDA website: http://www.fda.gov/ \n \n.\n\n\n\nPsychotherapies\n\n\n\nSeveral types of psychotherapy: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/psychotherapies \n: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/psychotherapies \n (also called talk therapy or counseling) can help people with depression by teaching them new ways of thinking and behaving and how to change habits that contribute to depression. Evidence-based approaches to treating depression include cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy (IPT). Learn more about\n psychotherapy: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/psychotherapies \n: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/psychotherapies \n\n.\n\n\n\nThe growth of \ntelehealth for mental health services: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/what-is-telemental-health \n\n, which offers an alternative to in-person therapy, has made it easier and more convenient for people to access care in some cases. For people who may have been hesitant to look for mental health care in the past, telemental health services might be an easier first step than traditional mental health services.\n\n\n\nBrain stimulation therapies\n\n\n\nIf medication: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/mental-health-medications \n or psychotherapy: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/psychotherapies \n: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/psychotherapies \n does not reduce symptoms of depression, brain stimulation therapy: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/brain-stimulation-therapies/brain-stimulation-therapies \n may be an option to explore. There are now several types of brain stimulation therapy: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/brain-stimulation-therapies/brain-stimulation-therapies \n, some of which have been authorized by the FDA to treat depression. Other brain stimulation therapies: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/brain-stimulation-therapies/brain-stimulation-therapies \n are experimental and still being investigated for treating mental disorders like depression.\n\n\n\nAlthough brain stimulation therapies: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/brain-stimulation-therapies/brain-stimulation-therapies \n are less frequently used than medication: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/mental-health-medications \n and psychotherapy: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/psychotherapies \n: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/psychotherapies \n, they can play an important role in treating mental disorders in people who do not respond to other treatments. These therapies are used for most mental disorders only after medication: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/mental-health-medications \n and psychotherapy: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/psychotherapies \n: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/psychotherapies \n have been tried and usually continue to be used alongside these treatments.\n\n\n\nBrain stimulation therapies act by activating or inhibiting the brain with electricity. The electricity is given directly through electrodes implanted in the brain or indirectly through electrodes placed on the scalp. The electricity can also be induced by applying magnetic fields to the head.\n\n\n\nThe brain stimulation therapies: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/brain-stimulation-therapies/brain-stimulation-therapies \n with the largest bodies of evidence include:\n\n\n\nElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT)\n\n\t\nRepetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)\n\n\t\nVagus nerve stimulation (VNS)\n\n\t\nMagnetic seizure therapy (MST)\n\n\t\nDeep brain stimulation (DBS)\n\n\nECT and rTMS are the most widely used brain stimulation therapies: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/brain-stimulation-therapies/brain-stimulation-therapies \n, with ECT having the longest history of use. The other therapies are newer and, in some cases, still considered experimental. Other brain stimulation therapies: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/brain-stimulation-therapies/brain-stimulation-therapies \n may also hold promise for treating specific mental disorders.\n\n\n\nECT, rTMS, and VNS have authorization from the FDA to treat severe, treatment-resistant depression. They can be effective for people who have not been able to feel better with other treatments or for whom medication: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/mental-health-medications \ns cannot be used safely and in severe cases where a rapid response is needed, such as when a person is catatonic, suicidal, or malnourished.\n\n\n\nWhereas ECT involves using electricity to induce seizures, in rTMS, a magnet is used to activate the brain. Unlike ECT, in which stimulation is more generalized, in rTMS, the stimulation is targeted to a specific brain site. Both procedures are noninvasive and do not require surgery to perform. In contrast, VNS is usually a surgical procedure that involves implanting a device under the skin to activate the vagus nerve.\n\n\n\nAdditional types of brain stimulation therapy: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/brain-stimulation-therapies/brain-stimulation-therapies \n are being investigated for treating depression and other mental disorders. Learn more about these \nbrain stimulation therapies: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/brain-stimulation-therapies/brain-stimulation-therapies \n\n. Talk to a health care provider and make sure you understand the potential benefits and risks before undergoing brain stimulation therapy: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/brain-stimulation-therapies/brain-stimulation-therapies \n.\n\n\n\nAlternative treatments\n\n\n\nThe FDA has not approved any natural products for depression. Although research is ongoing, some people use natural products, including vitamin D and the herbal dietary supplement St. John’s wort, for depression. However, these products can come with risks. For instance, dietary supplements and natural products can limit the effectiveness of some medication: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/mental-health-medications \ns or interact in dangerous or even life-threatening ways with them.\n\n\n\nDo not use vitamin D, St. John’s wort, or other dietary supplements or natural products without talking to a health care provider. Rigorous studies must be conducted to test whether these and other natural products are safe and effective.\n\n\n\nDaily morning \nlight therapy: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/seasonal-affective-disorder#part_6693 \n\n is a common treatment choice for people with seasonal affective disorder. Light therapy devices are much brighter than ordinary indoor lighting and considered safe, except for people with certain eye diseases or taking medication: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/mental-health-medications \ns that increase sensitivity to sunlight. As with all interventions for depression, evaluation, treatment, and follow-up by a health care provider are strongly recommended. Research into the potential role of light therapy: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/seasonal-affective-disorder#part_6693 \n in treating non-seasonal depression is ongoing.\n\n\n\n\n"},

{"title": "Bipolar Disorder", "heading": "Overview", "text": "\n  \nOverview\n\n  \n    \nBipolar disorder (formerly called manic-depressive illness or manic depression) is a mental illness that causes unusual shifts in a person’s mood, energy, activity levels, and concentration. These shifts can make it difficult to carry out day-to-day tasks.\n\n\n\nThere are three types of bipolar disorder. All three types involve clear changes in mood, energy, and activity levels. These moods range from periods of extremely “up,” elated, irritable, or energized behavior (known as manic episodes) to very “down,” sad, indifferent, or hopeless periods (known as depressive episodes). Less severe manic periods are known as hypomanic episodes.\n\n\n\nBipolar I disorder\n is defined by manic episodes that last for at least 7 days (nearly every day for most of the day) or by manic symptoms that are so severe that the person needs immediate medical care. Usually, depressive episodes occur as well, typically lasting at least 2 weeks. Episodes of depression with mixed features (having depressive symptoms and manic symptoms at the same time) are also possible. Experiencing four or more episodes of mania or depression within 1 year is called “rapid cycling.”\n\n\t\nBipolar II disorder\n is defined by a pattern of depressive episodes and hypomanic episodes. The hypomanic episodes are less severe than the manic episodes in bipolar I disorder.\n\n\t\nCyclothymic disorder\n (also called cyclothymia) is defined by recurring hypomanic and depressive symptoms that are not intense enough or do not last long enough to qualify as hypomanic or depressive episodes.\n\n\nSometimes a person might experience symptoms of bipolar disorder that do not match the three categories listed above, and this is referred to as “other specified and unspecified bipolar and related disorders.”\n\n\n\nBipolar disorder is often diagnosed during late adolescence (teen years) or early adulthood. Sometimes, bipolar symptoms can appear in children. Although the symptoms may vary over time, bipolar disorder usually requires lifelong treatment. Following a prescribed treatment plan can help people manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life.\n\n\n"},
{"title": "Bipolar Disorder", "heading": "Signs and symptoms", "text": "\n  \nSigns and symptoms\n\n  \n    \n\n\nPeople with bipolar disorder experience periods of unusually intense emotion and changes in sleep patterns and activity levels, and engage in behaviors that are out of character for them—often without recognizing their likely harmful or undesirable effects. These distinct periods are called mood episodes. Mood episodes are very different from the person’s usual moods and behaviors. During an episode, the symptoms last every day for most of the day. Episodes may also last for longer periods, such as several days or weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\nSymptoms of a Manic Episode\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nSymptoms of a Depressive Episode\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nFeeling very up, high, elated, or extremely irritable or touchy\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nFeeling very down or sad, or anxious\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nFeeling jumpy or wired, more active than usual\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nFeeling slowed down or restless\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nHaving a decreased need for sleep\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nHaving trouble falling asleep, waking up too early, or sleeping too much\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nTalking fast about a lot of different things (“flight of ideas”)\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nTalking very slowly, feeling unable to find anything to say, or forgetting a lot\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nRacing thoughts\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nHaving trouble concentrating or making decisions\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nFeeling able to do many things at once without getting tired\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nFeeling unable to do even simple things\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nHaving excessive appetite for food, drinking, sex, or other pleasurable activities\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nHaving a lack of interest in almost all activities\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nFeeling unusually important, talented, or powerful\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nFeeling hopeless or worthless, or thinking about death or suicide\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\nSometimes people have both manic and depressive symptoms in the same episode, and this is called an episode with mixed features. During an episode with mixed features, people may feel very sad, empty, or hopeless while at the same time feeling extremely energized.\n\n\n\nA person may have bipolar disorder even if their symptoms are less extreme. For example, some people with bipolar II disorder experience hypomania, a less severe form of mania. During a hypomanic episode, a person may feel very good, be able to get things done, and keep up with day-to-day life. The person may not feel that anything is wrong, but family and friends may recognize changes in mood or activity levels as possible symptoms of bipolar disorder. Without proper treatment, people with hypomania can develop severe mania or depression.\n\n\n\nDiagnosis\n\n\n\nReceiving the right diagnosis and treatment can help people with bipolar disorder lead healthy and active lives. Talking with a health care provider is the first step. The health care provider can complete a physical exam and other necessary medical tests to rule out other possible causes. The health care provider may then conduct a mental health evaluation or provide a referral to a trained mental health care provider, such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or clinical social worker who has experience in diagnosing and treating bipolar disorder.\n\n\n\nMental health care providers usually diagnose bipolar disorder based on a person’s symptoms, lifetime history, experiences, and, in some cases, family history. Accurate diagnosis in youth is particularly important.\n\n\n\nFind \ntips to help prepare for and get the most out of your visit: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/tips-for-talking-with-your-health-care-provider \n\n with your health care provider.\n\n\n\nBipolar disorder and other conditions\n\n\n\nMany people with bipolar disorder also have other mental disorders or conditions such as \nanxiety disorders: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/anxiety-disorders \n\n,\n attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd \n\n, \nmisuse of drugs or alcohol: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/substance-use-and-mental-health \n\n, or \neating disorders.: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/eating-disorders \n\n Sometimes people who have severe manic or depressive episodes also have symptoms of \npsychosis: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/understanding-psychosis \n\n, which may include hallucinations or delusions. The psychotic symptoms tend to match the person’s extreme mood. For example, someone having psychotic symptoms during a depressive episode may falsely believe they are financially ruined, while someone having psychotic symptoms during a manic episode may falsely believe they are famous or have special powers.\n\n\n\nLooking at a person’s symptoms over the course of the illness and examining their family history can help a health care provider determine whether the person has bipolar disorder along with another disorder.\n\n\n\n\n"},
{"title": "Bipolar Disorder", "heading": "Risk factors", "text": "\n  \nRisk factors\n\n  \n    \n\n\nResearchers are studying possible causes of bipolar disorder. Most agree that there are many factors that are likely to contribute to a person’s chance of having the disorder.\n\n\n\nBrain structure and functioning:\n Some studies show that the brains of people with bipolar disorder differ in certain ways from the brains of people who do not have bipolar disorder or any other mental disorder. Learning more about these brain differences may help scientists understand bipolar disorder and determine which treatments will work best. At this time, health care providers base the diagnosis and treatment plan on a person’s symptoms and history, rather than brain imaging or other diagnostic tests.\n\n\n\nGenetics:\n Some research suggests that people with certain genes are more likely to develop bipolar disorder. Research also shows that people who have a parent or sibling with bipolar disorder have an increased chance of having the disorder themselves. Many genes are involved, and no one gene causes the disorder. Learning more about how genes play a role in bipolar disorder may help researchers develop new treatments.\n\n\n\n\n"},
{"title": "Bipolar Disorder", "heading": "Treatments and therapies", "text": "\n  \nTreatments and therapies\n\n  \n    \n\n\nTreatment can help many people, including those with the most severe forms of bipolar disorder. An effective treatment plan usually includes a combination of medication and psychotherapy, also called talk therapy.\n\n\n\nBipolar disorder is a lifelong illness. Episodes of mania and depression typically come back over time. Between episodes, many people with bipolar disorder are free of mood changes, but some people may have lingering symptoms. Long-term, continuous treatment can help people manage these symptoms.\n\n\n\nMedications\n\n\n\nCertain medications can help manage symptoms of bipolar disorder. Some people may need to try different medications and work with their health care provider to find the medications that work best.\n\n\n\nThe most common types of medications that health care providers prescribe include mood stabilizers and atypical antipsychotics. Mood stabilizers such as lithium or valproate can help prevent mood episodes or reduce their severity. Lithium also can decrease the risk of suicide. Health care providers may include medications that target sleep or anxiety as part of the treatment plan.\n\n\n\nAlthough bipolar depression is often treated with antidepressant medication, a mood stabilizer must be taken as well—taking an antidepressant without a mood stabilizer can trigger a manic episode or rapid cycling in a person with bipolar disorder.\n\n\n\nBecause people with bipolar disorder are more likely to seek help when they are depressed than when they are experiencing mania or hypomania, it is important for health care providers to take a careful medical history to ensure that bipolar disorder is not mistaken for depression.\n\n\n\nPeople taking medication should:\n\n\n\nTalk with their health care provider to understand the risks and benefits of the medication.\n\n\t\nTell their health care provider about any prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, or supplements they are already taking.\n\n\t\nReport any concerns about side effects to a health care provider right away. The health care provider may need to change the dose or try a different medication.\n\n\t\nRemember that medication for bipolar disorder must be taken consistently, as prescribed, even when one is feeling well.\n\n\nIt is important to talk to a health care provider before stopping a prescribed medication. Stopping a medication suddenly may lead symptoms to worsen or come back. You can find basic information about medications on \nNIMH's medications webpage: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/mental-health-medications \n\n. Read the latest medication warnings, patient medication guides, and information on newly approved medications on the \nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) website.: https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index.cfm?event=medguide.page \n \n\n\n\nPsychotherapy\n\n\n\nPsychotherapy, also called talk therapy, can be an effective part of treatment for people with bipolar disorder. Psychotherapy is a term for treatment techniques that aim to help people identify and change troubling emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. This type of therapy can provide support, education, and guidance to people with bipolar disorder and their families.\n\n\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an important treatment for depression, and CBT adapted for the treatment of insomnia can be especially helpful as part of treatment for bipolar depression.\n\n\n\nTreatment may also include newer therapies designed specifically for the treatment of bipolar disorder, including interpersonal and social rhythm therapy (IPSRT) and family-focused therapy.\n\n\n\nLearn more about the \nvarious types of psychotherapies: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/psychotherapies \n\n.\n\n\n\nOther treatment options\n\n\n\nSome people may find other treatments helpful in managing their bipolar symptoms:\n\n\n\nElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT)\n is a brain stimulation procedure that can help relieve severe symptoms of bipolar disorder. Health care providers may consider ECT when a person’s illness has not improved after other treatments, or in cases that require rapid response, such as with people who have a high suicide risk or catatonia (a state of unresponsiveness).\n\n\t\nRepetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)\n is a type of brain stimulation that uses magnetic waves to relieve depression over a series of treatment sessions. Although not as powerful as ECT, rTMS does not require general anesthesia and has a low risk of negative effects on memory and thinking.\n\n\t\nLight therapy \nis the best evidence-based treatment for \nseasonal affective disorder (SAD): https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/seasonal-affective-disorder \n\n, and many people with bipolar disorder experience seasonal worsening of depression or SAD in the winter. Light therapy may also be used to treat lesser forms of seasonal worsening of bipolar depression.\n\n\nUnlike specific psychotherapy and medication treatments that are scientifically proven to improve bipolar disorder symptoms, complementary health approaches for bipolar disorder, such as natural products, are not based on current knowledge or evidence. For more information, visit the \nNational Center for Complementary and Integrative Health website: https://www.nccih.nih.gov/ \n \n.\n\n\n\nFinding treatment\n\n\n\nA family health care provider is a good resource and can be the first stop in searching for help.

Treatment is the best way to start feeling better.\n\n\t\nFollow the treatment plan as directed. Work with a health care provider to adjust the plan, as needed.\n\n\t\nStructure your activities. Try to have a routine for eating, sleeping, and exercising.\n\n\t\nTry regular, vigorous exercise like jogging, swimming, or bicycling, which can help with depression and anxiety, promote better sleep, and support your heart and brain health.\n\n\t\nTrack your moods, activities, and overall health and well-being to help recognize your mood swings.\n\n\t\nAsk trusted friends and family members for help in keeping up with your treatment plan.\n\n\t\nBe patient. Improvement takes time. Staying connected with sources of social support can help.\n\n\nLong-term, ongoing treatment can help control symptoms and enable you to live a healthy life.\n\n\n\n\n"},

Children with a higher likelihood of ASD include those who have a family member with ASD, show some behaviors that are typical of ASD, have older parents, have certain genetic conditions, or who had a very low birth weight.\n\n\n\nConsidering caregivers’ experiences and concerns is an important part of the screening process for young children. The health care provider may ask questions about the child’s behaviors and evaluate those answers in combination with information from ASD screening tools and clinical observations of the child. Read more about \nscreening instruments: http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/hcp-screening.html \n \n on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website.\n\n\n\nIf a child shows developmental differences in behavior or functioning during this screening process, the health care provider may refer the child for additional evaluation.\n\n\n\nStage 2: Additional diagnostic evaluation\n\n\n\nIt is important to accurately detect and diagnose children with ASD as early as possible, as this will shed light on their unique strengths and challenges. Early detection also can help caregivers determine which services, educational programs, and behavioral therapies are most likely to be helpful for their child.\n\n\n\nA team of health care providers who have experience diagnosing ASD will conduct the diagnostic evaluation. This team may include child neurologists, developmental pediatricians, speech-language pathologists, child psychologists and psychiatrists, educational specialists, and occupational therapists.\n\n\n\nThe diagnostic evaluation is likely to include:\n\n\n\nMedical and neurological examinations\n\n\t\nAssessment of the child’s cognitive abilities\n\n\t\nAssessment of the child’s language abilities\n\n\t\nObservation of the child’s behavior\n\n\t\nAn in-depth conversation with the child’s caregivers about the child’s behavior and development\n\n\t\nAssessment of age-appropriate skills needed to complete daily activities independently, such as eating, dressing, and toileting\n\n\nBecause ASD is a complex disorder that sometimes occurs with other illnesses or learning disorders, the comprehensive evaluation may include:\n\n\n\nBlood tests\n\n\t\nHearing test\n\n\nThe evaluation may lead to a formal diagnosis and recommendations for treatment.\n\n\n\nDiagnosis in older children and adolescents\n\n\n\nCaregivers and teachers are often the first to recognize ASD symptoms in older children and adolescents who attend school. The school’s special education team may perform an initial evaluation and then recommend that a child undergo additional evaluation with their primary health care provider or a health care provider who specialize in ASD.\n\n\n\nA child’s caregivers may talk with these health care providers about their child’s social difficulties, including problems with subtle communication. For example, some children may have problems understanding tone of voice, facial expressions, or body language. Older children and adolescents may have trouble understanding figures of speech, humor, or sarcasm. They also may have trouble forming friendships with peers.\n\n\n\nDiagnosis in adults\n\n\n\nDiagnosing ASD in adults is often more difficult than diagnosing ASD in children. In adults, some ASD symptoms can overlap with symptoms of other mental health disorders, such as anxiety disorder or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\n\n\n\nAdults who notice signs of ASD should talk with a health care provider and ask for a referral for an ASD evaluation. Although evaluation for ASD in adults is still being refined, adults may be referred to a neuropsychologist, psychologist, or psychiatrist who has experience with ASD. The expert will ask about:\n\n\n\nSocial interaction and communication challenges\n\n\t\nSensory issues\n\n\t\nRepetitive behaviors\n\n\t\nRestricted interests\n\n\nThe evaluation also may include a conversation with caregivers or other family members to learn about the person’s early developmental history, which can help ensure an accurate diagnosis.\n\n\n\nReceiving a correct diagnosis of ASD as an adult can help a person understand past challenges, identify personal strengths, and find the right kind of help. Studies are underway to determine the types of services and supports that are most helpful for improving the functioning and community integration of autistic transition-age youth and adults.\n\n\n"},

{"title": "Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder", "heading": "What are the signs and symptoms of ADHD?", "text": "\n  \nWhat are the signs and symptoms of ADHD?\n\n  \n    \nSome people with ADHD mainly have symptoms of inattention. Others mostly have symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity. Some people have both types of symptoms.\nMany people experience some inattention, unfocused motor activity, and impulsivity, but for people with ADHD, these behaviors:\nAre more severe\nOccur more often\nInterfere with or reduce the quality of how they function socially, at school, or in a job\nInattention\nPeople with symptoms of inattention may often:\nOverlook or miss details and make seemingly careless mistakes in schoolwork, at work, or during other activities\nHave difficulty sustaining attention during play or tasks, such as conversations, lectures, or lengthy reading\nNot seem to listen when spoken to directly\nFind it hard to follow through on instructions or finish schoolwork, chores, or duties in the workplace, or may start tasks but lose focus and get easily sidetracked\nHave difficulty organizing tasks and activities, doing tasks in sequence, keeping materials and belongings in order, managing time, and meeting deadlines\nAvoid tasks that require sustained mental effort, such as homework, or for teens and older adults, preparing reports, completing forms, or reviewing lengthy papers\nLose things necessary for tasks or activities, such as school supplies, pencils, books, tools, wallets, keys, paperwork, eyeglasses, and cell phones\nBe easily distracted by unrelated thoughts or stimuli\nBe forgetful in daily activities, such as chores, errands, returning calls, and keeping appointments\nHyperactivity-impulsivity\nPeople with symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity may often:\nFidget and squirm while seated\nLeave their seats in situations when staying seated is expected, such as in the classroom or the office\nRun, dash around, or climb at inappropriate times or, in teens and adults, often feel restless\nBe unable to play or engage in hobbies quietly\nBe constantly in motion or on the go, or act as if driven by a motor\nTalk excessively\nAnswer questions before they are fully asked, finish other people’s sentences, or speak without waiting for a turn in a conversation\nHave difficulty waiting one’s turn\nInterrupt or intrude on others, for example in conversations, games, or activities\nPrimary care providers sometimes diagnose and treat ADHD. They may also refer individuals to a mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist or clinical psychologist, who can do a thorough evaluation and make an ADHD diagnosis.\nFor a person to receive a diagnosis of ADHD, the symptoms of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity must be chronic or long-lasting, impair the person’s functioning, and cause the person to fall behind typical development for their age. Stress, sleep disorders, anxiety, depression, and other physical conditions or illnesses can cause similar symptoms to those of ADHD. Therefore, a thorough evaluation is necessary to determine the cause of the symptoms.\nMost children with ADHD receive a diagnosis during the elementary school years. For an adolescent or adult to receive a diagnosis of ADHD, the symptoms need to have been present before age 12.\nADHD symptoms can appear as early as between the ages of 3 and 6 and can continue through adolescence and adulthood. Symptoms of ADHD can be mistaken for emotional or disciplinary problems or missed entirely in children who primarily have symptoms of inattention, leading to a delay in diagnosis. Adults with undiagnosed ADHD may have a history of poor academic performance, problems at work, or difficult or failed relationships.\nADHD symptoms can change over time as a person ages. In young children with ADHD, hyperactivity-impulsivity is the most predominant symptom. As a child reaches elementary school, the symptom of inattention may become more prominent and cause the child to struggle academically. In adolescence, hyperactivity seems to lessen and symptoms may more likely include feelings of restlessness or fidgeting, but inattention and impulsivity may remain. Many adolescents with ADHD also struggle with relationships and antisocial behaviors. Inattention, restlessness, and impulsivity tend to persist into adulthood.\n\n"},
{"title": "Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder", "heading": "What are the risk factors of ADHD?", "text": "\n  \nWhat are the risk factors of ADHD?\n\n  \n    \n\n\nResearchers are not sure what causes ADHD, although many studies suggest that genes play a large role. Like many other disorders, ADHD probably results from a combination of factors. In addition to genetics, researchers are looking at possible environmental factors that might raise the risk of developing ADHD and are studying how brain injuries, nutrition, and social environments might play a role in ADHD.\n\n\n\nADHD is more common in males than females, and females with ADHD are more likely to primarily have inattention symptoms. People with ADHD often have other conditions, such as learning disabilities, anxiety disorder, conduct disorder, depression, and substance use disorder.\n\n\n\n\n"},
{"title": "Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder", "heading": "How is ADHD treated?", "text": "\n  \nHow is ADHD treated?\n\n  \n    \nWhile there is no cure for ADHD, currently available treatments may reduce symptoms and improve functioning. Treatments include medication, psychotherapy: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/psychotherapies \n, education or training, or a combination of treatments.\nMedication\nFor many people, ADHD medications reduce hyperactivity and impulsivity and improve their ability to focus, work, and learn. Sometimes several different medications or dosages must be tried before finding the right one that works for a particular person. Anyone taking medications must be monitored closely by their prescribing doctor.\nStimulants.\n The most common type of medication used for treating ADHD is called a “stimulant.” Although it may seem unusual to treat ADHD with a medication that is considered a stimulant, it works by increasing the brain chemicals dopamine and norepinephrine, which play essential roles in thinking and attention.\nUnder medical supervision, stimulant medications are considered safe. However, like all medications, they can have side effects, especially when misused or taken in excess of the prescribed dose, and require an individual’s health care provider to monitor how they may be reacting to the medication.\nNon-stimulants.\n A few other ADHD medications are non-stimulants. These medications take longer to start working than stimulants, but can also improve focus, attention, and impulsivity in a person with ADHD. Doctors may prescribe a non-stimulant: when a person has bothersome side effects from stimulants, when a stimulant was not effective, or in combination with a stimulant to increase effectiveness.\nAlthough not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) specifically for the treatment of ADHD, some antidepressants are used alone or in combination with a stimulant to treat ADHD. Antidepressants may help all of the symptoms of ADHD and can be prescribed if a patient has bothersome side effects from stimulants. Antidepressants can be helpful in combination with stimulants if a patient also has another condition, such as an anxiety disorder, depression, or another mood disorder. Non-stimulant ADHD medications and antidepressants may also have side effects.\nDoctors and patients can work together to find the best medication, dose, or medication combination. To find the latest information about medications, talk to a health care provider and visit the \nFDA website: http://www.fda.gov/ \n \n.\nPsychotherapy and psychosocial interventions\nSeveral specific psychosocial interventions have been shown to help individuals with ADHD and their families manage symptoms and improve everyday functioning.\nFor school-age children, frustration, blame, and anger may have built up within a family before a child is diagnosed. Parents and children may need specialized help to overcome negative feelings. Mental health professionals can educate parents about ADHD and how it affects a family. They also will help the child and his or her parents develop new skills, attitudes, and ways of relating to each other.\nAll types of therapy for children and teens with ADHD require parents to play an active role. Psychotherapy that includes only individual treatment sessions with the child (without parent involvement) is not effective for managing ADHD symptoms and behavior. This type of treatment is more likely to be effective for treating symptoms of anxiety or depression that may occur along with ADHD.\nBehavioral therapy\n is a type of psychotherapy: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/psychotherapies \n that aims to help a person change their behavior. It might involve practical assistance, such as help organizing tasks or completing schoolwork, or working through emotionally difficult events. Behavioral therapy also teaches a person how to:\nMonitor their own behavior\nGive oneself praise or rewards for acting in a desired way, such as controlling anger or thinking before acting\nParents, teachers, and family members also can give feedback on certain behaviors and help establish clear rules, chore lists, and structured routines to help a person control their behavior. Therapists may also teach children social skills, such as how to wait their turn, share toys, ask for help, or respond to teasing. Learning to read facial expressions and the tone of voice in others, and how to respond appropriately can also be part of social skills training.\nCognitive behavioral therapy\n helps a person learn how to be aware and accepting of one’s own thoughts and feelings to improve focus and concentration. The therapist also encourages the person with ADHD to adjust to the life changes that come with treatment, such as thinking before acting, or resisting the urge to take unnecessary risks.\nFamily and marital therapy\n can help family members and spouses find productive ways to handle disruptive behaviors, encourage behavior changes, and improve interactions with the person with ADHD.\nParenting skills training (behavioral parent management training)\n teaches parents skills for encouraging and rewarding positive behaviors in their children. Parents are taught to use a system of rewards and consequences to change a child’s behavior, to give immediate and positive feedback for behaviors they want to encourage, and to ignore or redirect behaviors they want to discourage.\nSpecific behavioral classroom management interventions and/or academic accommodations\n for children and teens have been shown to be effective for managing symptoms and improving functioning at school and with peers. Interventions may include behavior management plans or teaching organizational or study skills. Accommodations may include preferential seating in the classroom, reduced classwork load, or extended time on tests and exams. The school may provide accommodations through what is called a 504 Plan or, for children who qualify for special education services, an Individualized Education Plan (IEP). \nTo learn more about the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), visit the \nU.S. Department of Education’s IDEA website: http://idea.ed.gov/ \n \n.\nStress management techniques\n can benefit parents of children with ADHD by increasing their ability to deal with frustration so that they can respond calmly to their child’s behavior.\nSupport groups\n can help parents and families connect with others who have similar problems and concerns. Groups often meet regularly to share frustrations and successes, to exchange information about recommended specialists and strategies, and to talk with experts.\nThe National Resource Center on ADHD, a program of Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADD®) supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), has information and many resources.

Keep the same routine every day, from wake-up time to bedtime. Include times for homework, outdoor play, and indoor activities. Keep the schedule on the refrigerator or a bulletin board. Write changes on the schedule as far in advance as possible.\nOrganizing everyday items. Have a place for everything, (such as clothing, backpacks, and toys), and keep everything in its place.\nUsing homework and notebook organizers. Use organizers for school material and supplies. Stress to your child the importance of writing down assignments and bringing home necessary books.\nBeing clear and consistent. Children with ADHD need consistent rules they can understand and follow.\nGiving praise or rewards when rules are followed. Children with ADHD often receive and expect criticism. Look for good behavior and praise it.\nFor adults:\nA professional counselor or therapist can help an adult with ADHD learn how to organize their life with tools such as:\nKeeping routines.\nMaking lists for different tasks and activities.\nUsing a calendar for scheduling events.\nUsing reminder notes.\nAssigning a special place for keys, bills, and paperwork.\nBreaking down large tasks into more manageable, smaller steps so that completing each part of the task provides a sense of accomplishment.\n\n"},

Panic attacks can occur as frequently as several times a day or as rarely as a few times a year.\n\n\n\nSocial anxiety disorder\n\n\n\nSocial anxiety disorder is an intense, persistent fear of being watched and judged by others. For people with social anxiety disorder, the fear of social situations may feel so intense that it seems beyond their control. For some people, this fear may get in the way of going to work, attending school, or doing everyday things.\n\n\n\nPeople with social anxiety disorder may experience:\n\n\n\nBlushing, sweating, or trembling\n\n\t\nPounding or racing heart\n\n\t\nStomachaches\n\n\t\nRigid body posture or speaking with an overly soft voice\n\n\t\nDifficulty making eye contact or being around people they don’t know\n\n\t\nFeelings of self-consciousness or fear that people will judge them negatively\n\n\nPhobia-related disorders\n\n\n\nA \nphobia\n is an intense fear of—or aversion to—specific objects or situations. Although it can be realistic to be anxious in some circumstances, the fear people with phobias feel is out of proportion to the actual danger caused by the situation or object.\n\n\n\nPeople with a phobia:\n\n\n\nMay have an irrational or excessive worry about encountering the feared object or situation\n\n\t\nTake active steps to avoid the feared object or situation\n\n\t\nExperience immediate intense anxiety upon encountering the feared object or situation\n\n\t\nEndure unavoidable objects and situations with intense anxiety\n\n\nThere are several types of phobias and phobia-related disorders:\n\n\n\nSpecific Phobias (sometimes called simple phobias)\n: As the name suggests, people who have a specific phobia have an intense fear of, or feel intense anxiety about, specific types of objects or situations. Some examples of specific phobias include the fear of:\n\n\n\nFlying\n\n\t\nHeights\n\n\t\nSpecific animals, such as spiders, dogs, or snakes\n\n\t\nReceiving injections\n\n\t\nBlood\n\n\nSocial anxiety disorder (previously called social phobia)\n: People with social anxiety disorder have a general intense fear of, or anxiety toward, social or performance situations. They worry that actions or behaviors associated with their anxiety will be negatively evaluated by others, leading them to feel embarrassed. This worry often causes people with social anxiety to avoid social situations. Social anxiety disorder can manifest in a range of situations, such as within the workplace or the school environment.\n\n\n\nAgoraphobia:\n People with agoraphobia have an intense fear of two or more of the following situations:\n\n\n\nUsing public transportation\n\n\t\nBeing in open spaces\n\n\t\nBeing in enclosed spaces\n\n\t\nStanding in line or being in a crowd\n\n\t\nBeing outside of the home alone\n\n\nPeople with agoraphobia often avoid these situations, in part, because they think being able to leave might be difficult or impossible in the event they have panic-like reactions or other embarrassing symptoms. In the most severe form of agoraphobia, an individual can become housebound.\n\n\n\nSeparation anxiety disorder:\n Separation anxiety is often thought of as something that only children deal with. However, adults can also be diagnosed with separation anxiety disorder. People with separation anxiety disorder fear being away from the people they are close to. They often worry that something bad might happen to their loved ones while they are not together. This fear makes them avoid being alone or away from their loved ones. They may have bad dreams about being separated or feel unwell when separation is about to happen.\n\n\n\n\n\nSelective mutism: \nA somewhat rare disorder associated with anxiety is \nselective mutism\n. Selective mutism occurs when people fail to speak in specific social situations despite having normal language skills. Selective mutism usually occurs before the age of 5 and is often associated with extreme shyness, fear of social embarrassment, compulsive traits, withdrawal, clinging behavior, and temper tantrums. People diagnosed with selective mutism are often also diagnosed with other anxiety disorders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},

{"title": "Anxiety Disorders", "heading": "How is anxiety treated?", "text": "\n  \nHow is anxiety treated?\n\n  \n    \n\n\nAnxiety disorders are generally treated with psychotherapy, medication, or both. There are many ways to treat anxiety, and you should work with a health care provider to choose the best treatment for you.\n\n\n\nPsychotherapy\n\n\n\nPsychotherapy or “talk therapy” can help people with anxiety disorders. To be effective, psychotherapy must be directed at your specific anxieties and tailored to your needs.\n\n\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy\n\n\n\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is an example of one type of psychotherapy that can help people with anxiety disorders. It teaches people different ways of thinking, behaving, and reacting to situations to help you feel less anxious and fearful. CBT has been well studied and is the gold standard for psychotherapy.\n\n\n\nExposure therapy is a CBT method that is used to treat anxiety disorders. Exposure therapy focuses on confronting the fears underlying an anxiety disorder to help people engage in activities they have been avoiding. Exposure therapy is sometimes used along with relaxation exercises.\n\n\n\nAcceptance and commitment therapy \n\n\n\nAnother treatment option for some anxiety disorders is acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). ACT takes a different approach than CBT to negative thoughts. It uses strategies such as mindfulness and goal setting to reduce discomfort and anxiety. Compared to CBT, ACT is a newer form of psychotherapy treatment, so less data are available on its effectiveness.\n\n\n\nMedication\n\n\n\nMedication does not cure anxiety disorders but can help relieve symptoms. Health care providers, such as a psychiatrist or primary care provider, can prescribe medication for anxiety. Some states also allow psychologists who have received specialized training to prescribe psychiatric medications. The most common classes of medications used to combat anxiety disorders are antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications (such as benzodiazepines), and beta-blockers.\n\n\n\nAntidepressants\n\n\n\nAntidepressants are used to treat depression, but they can also be helpful for treating anxiety disorders. They may help improve the way your brain uses certain chemicals that control mood or stress. You may need to try several different antidepressant medicines before finding the one that improves your symptoms and has manageable side effects.\n\n\n\nAntidepressants can take several weeks to start working so it’s important to give the medication a chance before reaching a conclusion about its effectiveness. If you begin taking antidepressants, do not stop taking them without the help of a health care provider. Your provider can help you slowly and safely decrease your dose. Stopping them abruptly can cause withdrawal symptoms.\n\n\n\nIn some cases, children, teenagers, and adults younger than 25 may experience increased suicidal thoughts or behavior when taking antidepressant medications, especially in the first few weeks after starting or when the dose is changed. Because of this, people of all ages taking antidepressants should be watched closely, especially during the first few weeks of treatment.\n\n\n\nAnti-anxiety medications\n\n\n\nAnti-anxiety medications can help reduce the symptoms of anxiety, panic attacks, or extreme fear and worry. The most common anti-anxiety medications are called benzodiazepines. Although benzodiazepines are sometimes used as first-line treatments for generalized anxiety disorder, they have both benefits and drawbacks.\n\n\n\nBenzodiazepines are effective in relieving anxiety and take effect more quickly than antidepressant medications. However, some people build up a tolerance to these medications and need higher and higher doses to get the same effect. Some people even become dependent on them.\n\n\n\nTo avoid these problems, health care providers usually prescribe benzodiazepines for short periods of time.\n\n\n\nIf people suddenly stop taking benzodiazepines, they may have withdrawal symptoms, or their anxiety may return. Therefore, benzodiazepines should be tapered off slowly. Your provider can help you slowly and safely decrease your dose.\n\n\n\nBeta-blockers\n\n\n\nAlthough beta-blockers are most often used to treat high blood pressure, they can help relieve the physical symptoms of anxiety, such as rapid heartbeat, shaking, trembling, and blushing. These medications can help people keep physical symptoms under control when taken for short periods. They can also be used “as needed” to reduce acute anxiety, including to prevent some predictable forms of performance anxieties.\n\n\n\nChoosing the right medication\n\n\n\nSome types of drugs may work better for specific types of anxiety disorders, so people should work closely with a health care provider to identify which medication is best for them. Certain substances such as caffeine, some over-the-counter cold medicines, illicit drugs, and herbal supplements may aggravate the symptoms of anxiety disorders or interact with prescribed medication. People should talk with a health care provider, so they can learn which substances are safe and which to avoid.\n\n\n\nChoosing the right medication, medication dose, and treatment plan should be done under an expert’s care and should be based on a person’s needs and their medical situation. Your and your provider may try several medicines before finding the right one.\n\n\n\nSupport groups\n\n\n\nSome people with anxiety disorders might benefit from joining a self-help or support group and sharing their problems and achievements with others. Support groups are available both in person and online. However, any advice you receive from a support group member should be used cautiously and does not replace treatment recommendations from a health care provider.\n\n\n\nStress management techniques\n\n\n\nStress management techniques, such as exercise, mindfulness, and meditation, also can reduce anxiety symptoms and enhance the effects of psychotherapy. You can learn more about how these techniques benefit your treatment by talking with a health care provider.\n\n\n\n\n"},

Common \nobsessions \ninclude:\nFear of germs or contamination\nFear of forgetting, losing, or misplacing something\nFear of losing control over one’s behavior\nAggressive thoughts toward others or oneself\nUnwanted, forbidden, or taboo thoughts involving sex, religion, or harm\nDesire to have things symmetrical or in perfect order\nCompulsions\n are repetitive behaviors a person feels the urge to do, often in response to an obsession. Common compulsions include:\nExcessive cleaning or handwashing\nOrdering or arranging items in a particular, precise way\nRepeatedly checking things, such as that the door is locked or the oven is off\nCompulsive counting\nPraying or repeating words silently\nNot all repeated thoughts are obsessions, and not all rituals or habits are compulsions. However, people with OCD generally:\nCan’t control their obsessions or compulsions, even when they know they’re excessive.\nSpend more than 1 hour a day on their obsessions or compulsions.\nDon’t get pleasure from their compulsions but may feel temporary relief from their anxiety.\nExperience significant problems in daily life due to these thoughts or behaviors.  \nSome people with OCD also have a tic disorder involving repetitive movements or sounds. Motor tics are sudden, brief, repetitive movements, such as eye blinking and other eye movements, facial grimacing, shoulder shrugging, and head or shoulder jerking. Vocal tics include things like repetitive throat-clearing, sniffing, or grunting sounds. It is common for people with OCD to also have a diagnosed mood disorder or anxiety disorder.\nOCD symptoms may begin anytime but usually start between late childhood and young adulthood. Most people with OCD are diagnosed as young adults.\nThe symptoms of OCD may start slowly and can go away for a while or worsen as time passes. During times of stress, the symptoms often get worse. A person’s obsessions and compulsions also may change over time.\nPeople with OCD might avoid situations that trigger their symptoms or use drugs or alcohol to cope. Many adults with OCD recognize that their compulsive behaviors do not make sense. However, children may not realize that their behavior is out of the ordinary and often fear that something terrible will happen if they do not perform certain compulsive rituals. Parents or teachers typically recognize OCD symptoms in children.\nIf you think you or your child may have OCD, talk to a health care provider. If left untreated, OCD symptoms can become severe and interfere with daily life.\n\n"},

", "text": "\n  \nWhat are the risk factors for OCD? \n\n  \n    \nAlthough the exact causes of OCD are unknown, various risk factors increase the chances of developing the disorder.\nGenetics:\n Studies have shown that having a first-degree relative (parent or sibling) with OCD is associated with an increased chance of developing the disorder. Scientists have not identified any one gene or set of genes that definitively leads to OCD, but studies exploring the connection between genetics and OCD are ongoing. \nBiology:\n Brain imaging studies have shown that people with OCD often have differences in the frontal cortex and subcortical structures of the brain, areas of the brain that impact the ability to control behavior and emotional responses. Researchers also have found that several brain areas, brain networks, and biological processes play a key role in obsessive thoughts, compulsive behavior, and associated fear and anxiety. Research is underway to better understand the connection between OCD symptoms and parts of the brain. This knowledge can help researchers develop and adapt treatments targeted to specific brain locations.\nTemperament:\n Some research has found that people who exhibit more reserved behaviors, experience negative emotions, and show symptoms of anxiety and depression as children are more likely to develop OCD.\nChildhood trauma:\n Some studies have reported an association between childhood trauma and obsessive-compulsive symptoms.

{"title": "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder", "heading": "How is OCD treated?", "text": "\n  \nHow is OCD treated?\n\n  \n    \nTreatment helps many people, even those with the most severe forms of OCD. Mental health professionals treat OCD with medications, psychotherapy, or a combination of treatments. A mental health professional can help you decide which treatment option is best for you and explain the benefits and risks of each. \nFollowing your treatment plan is important because psychotherapy and medication can take some time to work. Although there is no cure for OCD, treatments help people manage their symptoms, engage in day-to-day activities, and lead full, active lives.\nPsychotherapy\nPsychotherapy\n can be an effective treatment for adults and children with OCD. Research shows that certain types of psychotherapy, including cognitive behavioral therapy and other related therapies, can be as effective as medication for many people. For others, psychotherapy may be most effective when combined with medication.\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): \nCBT is a type of talk therapy that helps people recognize harmful or untrue ways of thinking so they can more clearly view and respond to challenging situations. CBT helps people learn to question these negative thoughts, determine how they impact their feelings and actions, and change self-defeating behavior patterns. CBT has been well studied and is considered the “gold standard” of psychotherapy for many people. CBT works best when customized to treat the unique characteristics of specific mental disorders, including OCD.\nExposure and response prevention therapy (ERP): \nResearch shows that ERP, a specific type of CBT, effectively reduces compulsive behaviors, even for people who do not respond well to medication. With ERP, people spend time in a safe environment that gradually exposes them to situations that trigger their obsession (such as touching dirty objects) and prevent them from engaging in their typical compulsive behavior (such as handwashing). Although this approach may initially cause anxiety, creating a risk of dropping out of treatment prematurely, compulsions decrease for most people as they continue treatment.\nChildren with OCD may need additional help from family members and health care providers to recognize and manage their OCD symptoms. Mental health professionals can work with young children to identify strategies for managing stress and increasing support so they can control their OCD symptoms.\nMedication\nHealth care providers may prescribe medication to help treat OCD. The most common medications prescribed for OCD are antidepressants that target serotonin, a chemical transmitter in the brain involved in depression and OCD. The largest category of antidepressants is called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.\nAntidepressant treatment can take 8–12 weeks before symptoms begin to improve, and treatment for OCD may require higher doses than are typically used to treat depression. For some people, these medications may cause side effects such as headaches, nausea, or difficulty sleeping. Most people with OCD find that medication, often in combination with psychotherapy, can help them manage their symptoms.\nYour health care provider can adjust medication doses over time to minimize side effects or withdrawal symptoms. Do not stop taking your medication without first talking to your health care provider. They can work with you to monitor your health and adjust your treatment plan safely and effectively.\nThe most up-to-date \ninformation on medications, side effects, and warnings\n \n is available on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website.\nOther treatments\nIn 2018, the FDA approved using a deep form of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)—along with medication, psychotherapy, or a combination of both—to treat people with severe OCD who did not respond to other treatments. In 2022, this approval was extended to standard TMS devices.\nMost commonly used to treat depression, rTMS is a noninvasive therapy that uses a magnet to deliver repeated low-intensity pulses to stimulate a particular part of the brain. Unlike most treatments, rTMS can target specific brain areas associated with OCD.\nDeep brain stimulation (DBS)\n is a surgical procedure that uses electricity to directly stimulate sites in the brain. Health care providers may use DBS to treat people with severe OCD when other treatments have not worked. However, this therapy is considered experimental.\nAlthough DBS has received FDA approval to treat certain neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, its effectiveness for treating mental disorders is still being actively researched. The FDA has approved using DBS to treat severe cases of OCD under a Humanitarian Device Exemption. This exemption allows the use of a medical device, such as DBS, for rare diseases or conditions that affect a relatively small number of people, making it challenging to gather enough evidence to establish the device’s effectiveness.\nYou can find the latest information and guidance on \nbrain stimulation devices\n \n on the FDA’s website.\nFinding Treatment\nFor general information on mental health and to locate treatment services in your area, call the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) Treatment Referral Helpline at 1-800-662-HELP (4357).
